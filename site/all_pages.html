  </div>
      <p id='' >If you choose to read Delany's critical work alongside his fiction, his command of form becomes obvious. His writing about writing is literate and exemplary of acadmic writing. He obviously delights in using the most precise word he can find for what he's trying to communicate, even if that word is archaic, which enriches the critical form. But, oftentimes, this is a red flag that a writer's fiction will be dry, overwritten and dull. Not the case with Delany.</p>

  </div>
      <p id='' >Short story writers are always in need of short cuts: ways of getting the characters and scenes moving in the right direction with fewer words. This is easier said than done. It feels impossible to trim away words when staring at a piece of the story as large and important as the central conflict. It's better to start small.</p>

The opening of the story in particular is an example of breaking up exposotion with action. I'm going to reproduce it in full below and then walk through it section by section:</p>
