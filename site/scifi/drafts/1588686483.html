      <h1>Beginnings: You Only Get 3 Paragraphs</h1>
      <p><div class='pull'><div class='pull-quote'>The truth is, you have about three paragraphs in a short story, three pages in a novel, to capture that editor's attention enough for her to finish your story.</div><br><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;Beginnings, Middles & Ends - Nancy Kress</div></div></p>
      <p>A novella is long enough to support a prologue. <em>The Erdmann Nexus</em> by Nancy Kress features an exceptionally well written prolgue. Writing prologues is a tricky business. They should be disconnected from the first scene in substance, but not far removed in theme. They should also hint at conflict:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">To succeed, your prologue must contain a strong promise of conflict to come. Using the prologue to merely “set the scene” with passive descriptions of landscape or character background won't work. In Crichton's prologue to Jurassic Park, for example, a construction worker is severely mauled by an unidentified animal that, the cover picture indicates, will turn out to be a dinosaur—in contemporary Costa Rica. That certainly promises enough potential conflict to arouse readers' curiosity.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Beginnings, Middles & Ends - Nancy Kress</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>Here's the full prologue to <em>The Erdmann Nexus:</em></p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote"><em>The ship, which would have looked nothing like a ship to Henry Erdmann, moved between the stars, traveling in an orderly pattern of occurrences in the vacuum flux. Over several cubic light-years of space, subatomic particles appeared, existed, and winked out of existence in nanoseconds. Flop transitions tore space and then reconfigured it as the ship moved on. Henry, had he somehow been nearby in the cold of deep space, would have died from the complicated, regular, intense bursts of radiation long before he could have had time to appreciate their shimmering beauty.</em></div><div class="single-blockquote"><em>All at once the “ship” stopped moving.</em></div><div class="single-blockquote"><em>The radiation bursts increased, grew even more complex. Then the ship abruptly changed direction. It accelerated, altering both space and time as it sped on, healing the alterations in its wake. Urgency shot through it.</em></div><div class="single-blockquote"><em>Something, far away, was struggling to be born</em></div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>This introduction is brilliant for several reasons. First, it's a dramatic scene: something changes from beginning to end. The ship starts out travelling in an orderly way. By the end of the scene, it's not. This small inter-scene change hints at a larger conflict: <em>something struggling to be born.</em></p>
      <p>That final line holds a promise for the reader. Put another way: it raises a question. What is being born? That is the dramatic question.</p>
      <p>But Kress doesn't stop at that. There's two other questions raised: who is Henry Erdmann and how is he connected to this strange looking ship? Why does this ship look nothing like a ship?</p>
      <p>The reader continues on, confident that she'll get the answers to these questions. We get a partial answer in the opening scene:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Henry Erdmann stood in front of the mirror in his tiny bedroom, trying to knot his tie with one hand. The other hand gripped his walker. It was an unsteady business, and the tie ended up crooked. He yanked it out and began again. Carrie would be here soon.</div><div class="single-blockquote">He always wore a tie to the college. Let the students—and graduate students, at that!—come to class in ripped jeans and obscene T-shirts and hair tangled as if colonized by rats. Even the girls. Students were students, and Henry didn’t consider their sloppiness disrespectful, the way so many did at St. Sebastian’s. Sometimes he was even amused by it, in a sad sort of way. Didn’t these intelligent, sometimes driven, would-be physicists know how ephemeral their beauty was? Why did they go to such lengths to look unappealing, when soon enough that would be their only choice?</div><div class="single-blockquote">This time he got the tie knotted. Not perfectly—a difficult operation, one-handed—but close enough for government work. He smiled. When he and his colleagues had been doing government work, only perfection was good enough. Atomic bombs were like that. Henry could still hear Oppie’s voice saying the plans for Ivy Mike were “technically sweet.” Of course, that was before all the—</div><div class="single-blockquote">A knock on the door and Carrie’s fresh young voice. “Dr. Erdmann? Are you ready?”</div>

      <p>A writer doesn't have long to hook their reader, so the opening scene needs to be seriously compelling.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">[There are] four elements that make a first scene compelling: character, conflict, specificity and credibility.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Beginnings, Middles & Ends - Nancy Kress</div>

      <p>End of first scene:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">“Dr. Erdmann?”</div><div class="single-blockquote">“I’m here.” He clunked to the door and opened it. Carrie wore a cherry red sweater, a fallen orange leaf caught on her hat, and sunglasses. Such a pretty girl, all bronze hair and bright skin and vibrant color. Outside it was drizzling. Henry reached out and gently removed the sunglasses. Carrie’s left eye was swollen and discolored, the iris and pupil invisible under the outraged flesh.</div><div class="single-blockquote">“The bastard,” Henry said.</div>
