      <h1>Character v Character: Tension, Done Well</h1>
      <p>Short story writers are always in need of short cuts: ways of getting the characters and scenes moving in the right direction with fewer words. Tension is a prime candidate for cutting words. Maybe the simplest way to build toward conflict is to place two diametrically opposed characters in a room together. The tension is instant and inevitable.</p>
      <p>Theodore Sturgeon&mdash;Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inductee&mdash;effectively establishes tension in two sentences in the opening of <em>If All Men Were Brothers, Would You Let One Marry Your Sister?</em>.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <blockquote>The Archive Master had been around long enough to expect courtesy, respect, and submission, to get these things, and to like them. Charli Bux slammed into the room, banged a folio down on the desk, sat down uninvited, leaned forward and roared redly, "Goddamit&mdash;"</blockquote>

      <p>What a great passage! You can feel the beginnings of conflict beginning to build. You know that these two characters can't be in a room together for too long before something dramatic happens. This first interchange contains only one word of dialogue, but propels the characters forward, laying a rich mulch from which future dialogue can grow naturally.</p>
      <p>For instance, having two characters with very different affectations offers a natural path to exposition about their respective pasts. IE what makes them so different:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <blockquote>"I think you'd better begin somewhere." Then he added, not raising his voice, but with immense authority, "And quietly."</blockquote><blockquote>Charli Bux gave him a boom of laughter. "I never yet spent upwards of three minutes with anybody that they didn't shush me. Welcome to the Shush Charli Club, membership half the universe, potential membership, everybody else. And I'm sorry. I was born and brought up on Biluly where there's nothing but trade wind and split-rock ravines and surf, and the only way to whisper is to shout." He went on more quietly, "But what I'm talking about isn't that sort of shushing. I'm talking about a little thing here and a little thing there and adding them up and getting the idea that there's a planet nobody knows anything about."</blockquote>
</div>
</p>
      <p>The pattern of dialogue also follows the pattern established by that first interaction. The Archive Master speaks circuitously, only hinting at what he really wants to say. His sections of dialogue are drawn out by vague and non-commital wording. As soon as you the reader are tired of it, Charli jumps in with a single sentence that slices through all those gray words and cuts right to the point:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <blockquote>Seeing the closed eyes, the long white fingers tender on the white temples, Bux said, "I said I was sorry I yelled like that."</blockquote><blockquote>"In every city," said the Archive Master patiently, "on every settled human planet in all the known universe, there is a free public clinic where stress reactions of any sort may be diagnosed, treated or prescribed for, speedily, effectively, and with dignity. I trust you will not regard it as an intrusion on your privacy if I make the admittedly non-professional observation (you see, I do not pretend to be a therapist) that there are times when a citizen is not himself aware that he is under stress, even though it may be clearly, perhaps painfully obvious to others. It would not be a discourtesy, would it, or an unkindness, for some understanding stranger to suggest to such a citizen that&mdash;"</blockquote><blockquote>"What you're saying, all wrapped up in words, is I ought to go have my head candled."</blockquote><blockquote>"By no means. I am not qualified. I did, however, think that a visit to a clinic&mdash;there's one just a step away from here&mdash;might make&mdash;ah&mdash; communications between us more possible. I would be glad to arrange another appointment for you, when you're feeling better. That is to say, when you are... ah..." He finished with a bleak smile and reached toward the calling stud.</blockquote><blockquote>Moving almost like a Drive-ship, Bux seemed to cease to exist on the visitor's chair and reappeared instantaneously at the side of the desk, a long thick arm extended and a meaty hand blocking the way to the stud. "Hear me out first," he said, softly. Really softly. It was a much more astonishing thing than if the Archive Master had trumpeted like an elephant. "Hear me out. Please."</blockquote><blockquote>The old man withdrew his hand, but folded it with the other and set the neat stack of fingers on the edge of the desk. It looked like stubbornness.</blockquote>
