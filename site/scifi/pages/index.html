      <h2>The Triple Down Metaphor</h2>
      <p>Writers use metaphors to draw your attention, to highlight a thought. They are the flashy chrome trim that sells sportscars and brightens jalopies. If metaphors make a passage notable, extended metaphors make it memorable. Take this one, for example:</p>

      <h2>Character v Character: Tension, Done Well</h2>
      <p>Short story writers are always in need of short cuts: ways of getting the characters and scenes moving in the right direction with fewer words. This is easier said than done. It feels impossible to trim away words when staring at a piece of the story as large and important as the central conflict. It's better to start small.</p>

      <h2>What Came Before</h2>
      <p>One common way to provide the reader with more supporting information about the story is the flashback or analepsis. This is similar to <a target='' href='./1580270620.html'>using a flash-forward for exposition</a>.</p>

      <h2>The Le Guin Binary. The Nivenette.</h2>
      <p>The catalog of literary devices is vast. While reading, if I run across an unfamiliar device that deserves a highlight, it feels important to give it a name: something that will help me remember why I enjoyed it. Problem is, I don't know half of the proper names for these devices. So, they end up with temporary names:</p>

      <h2>Future Exposition, Now</h2>
      <p>Most short story writers take great pains to avoid inserting themselves as narrator to tell the reader directly about the world they've built. It's generally better to hide this world-building inside the story itself. So it's no surprise that there are endless techniques for hiding exposition.</p>

      <h2>Pairing Description with Action</h2>
      <p>Action is a natural complement to early descriptions of setting. Leanne Frahm's <em>The Wood for the Trees</em> offers a master class in description in general. The opening of the story in particular is an example of breaking up exposotion with action. I'm going to reproduce it in full below and then walk through it section by section:</p>

      <h2>The Care and Handling of Throwaway Characters</h2>
      <p>Throwaway characters. Every author has 'em, but not every author writes them the same way. Some authors give us a character's life story only to have them speak a line and disappear forever. Other authors push these characters so far into the background that they are treated like furniture&mdash;referenced by titles alone: the secretary, the general, the robot. I don't know about you, but by the third time I read "the AI said," I'm a bored reader.</p>
