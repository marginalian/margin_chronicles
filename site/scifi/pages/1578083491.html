      <h1>Pairing Description with Action</h1>
      <p>Action is a natural complement to early descriptions of setting. Leanne Frahm's <em>The Wood for the Trees</em> offers a master class in description in general. The opening of the story in particular is an example of breaking up exposotion with action. I'm going to reproduce it in full below and then walk through it section by section:</p>
      <p><div class='indent'><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>He rode to the suburb from the north. To his left, dawn was breaking, sending the first pearl-coloured streaks into the sky. He had been travelling through the night, following the freeway, but it had ended abruptly, buried under an old landslide. He had turned aside to pick his way through the thin patch of scrubby bush.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>  He knew he had reached the suburb when the vegetation gave way suddenly to the stubborn concrete of a shopping center's parking lot. It stretched agead of him, an immense open space. Nothing moved. He turned his attention to the remaining giant letters above him. Once they had made up part of the center's name. Now they hung askew, their bolts corroded through.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>  He pulled out one of his street maps, and opened it. The position was marked. He checked the nearby street names, then carefully folded the tattered paper and replaced it in his pack. With a low clicking of his tongue he urged the tired horse on, toward the center of the suburb.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>  His mount picked its way carefully over the cracked concrete while he studied his surroundings.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>  A rusted shopping cart lay to one side, stripped of its wheels. Small arcades branched off from the main building. Most windows were broken, the shelves emptied of useful items. A china shop stood undamaged; its painted plates and figurines glittering richly in the rays of the rising sun, while next door a furniture shop still boasted a disount on the deflated water bed in the window.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>  Silence hung over the morning. The birds were learning not to sing.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>  The bounty hunter turned his gaze toward the approaching streets and houses. Grass and weed clogged the gutters, and broke up the bitumen. Where street signs remained, they were barely legible; in some places, they were missing completely. The houses were unoccupied; engulfed in flowering bushes, roofs sagging. He expected that. They mostly clustered in the centers of the suburbs now, close to the government supplies.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>  A sudden movement sent his hand darting for the rifle slung over his shoulder. In a flurry of ruffled feathers and frightened peeping, a wild duck and two ducklings burst from the grass onto the open road.</div>

      <p>This opening creates a vivid world without devoting six paragraphs to dry, stale descriptions. How? By injecting action into the exposition.</p>
      <p>The first three paragraphs are action heavy with few snippets of description. They provide only a half-formed picture of the setting. Frahm uses the fourth paragraph as a transition point:</p>
      <blockquote>His mount picked its way carefully over the cracked concrete while he studied his surroundings.</blockquote>
      <p>This sentence is action that is closely centered on the main character. The character is studying his surroundings, and so the reader expects to see what he sees. This is a natural transition, that is crafted to hold the reader's attention.</p>
      <p>What comes next is two visually descriptive paragraphs. This section in particular stood out:</p>
      <blockquote>A china shop stood undamaged; its painted plates and figurines glittering richly in the rays of the rising sun, while next door a furniture shop still boasted a disount on the deflated water bed in the window.</blockquote>
      <p>The full block of description is long. Long enough that it's a small relief when Frahm adds a sentence of action:</p>
      <blockquote>The bounty hunter turned his gaze toward the approaching streets and houses.</blockquote>
      <p>It echoes the previous transition to description. This is important. Repetition can build a sense of clarity.</p>
      <p>These long blocks of visual description paint a clear picture. But if it went on too long, the painting would begin to feel one-dimensional, or immutable. That's why Frahm lets loose a lightning bolt of action:</p>
      <blockquote>A sudden movement sent his hand darting for the rifle slung over his shoulder. In a flurry of ruffled feathers and frightened peeping, a wild duck and two ducklings burst from the grass onto the open road.</blockquote>
      <p>Something from the painting jumps into action. As before, the action is tethered to the main character. Unlike before, the action is deliberately jarring. That is because it marks the end of the descriptive section and transitions the reader back into the normal flow of narrative.</p>
