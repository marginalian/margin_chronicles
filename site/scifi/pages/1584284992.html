      <h1>Character v Character: Tension, Done Well</h1>
      <p>Short story writers are always in need of short cuts: ways of getting the characters and scenes moving in the right direction with fewer words. This is easier said than done. It feels impossible to trim away words when staring at a piece of the story as large and important as the central conflict. It's better to start small.</p>
      <p>Tension often forms the beginnings of conflict and can be established quickly. Take, for example, the opening of <em>If All Men Were Brothers, Would You Let One Marry Your Sister?</em>. Theodore Sturgeon&mdash;Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inductee&mdash;effectively establishes tension in just two sentences.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>The Archive Master had been around long enough to expect courtesy, respect, and submission, to get these things, and to like them. Charli Bux slammed into the room, banged a folio down on the desk, sat down uninvited, leaned forward and roared redly, "Goddamit&mdash;"</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>What a great passage! You can feel the beginnings of conflict beginning to build. These two characters can't be in a room together for too long before something dramatic happens. This first interchange contains only one word of dialogue, but propels the characters forward, laying a rich mulch from which future dialogue can grow naturally. For instance, Sturgeon uses the characters' different mannerisms to explore one of their pasts and to answer the question of <em>what makes Charli this way?</em></p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>"I think you'd better begin somewhere." Then [the Archive Master] added, not raising his voice, but with immense authority, "And quietly."</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Charli Bux gave him a boom of laughter. "I never yet spent upwards of three minutes with anybody that they didn't shush me. Welcome to the Shush Charli Club, membership half the universe, potential membership, everybody else. And I'm sorry. I was born and brought up on Biluly where there's nothing but trade wind and split-rock ravines and surf, and the only way to whisper is to shout."</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>The dialogue also follows the pattern established by that first interaction. The reserved Archive Master speaks circuitously, only hinting at what he really wants to say. His sections of dialogue are drawn out by vague and non-commital wording. As soon as the reader is tired of it, Charli jumps in with a single sentence that slices through all those gray words and gets right to the point:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Seeing the closed eyes, the long white fingers tender on the white temples, Bux said, "I said I was sorry I yelled like that."</div><div class='single-blockquote'>"In every city," said the Archive Master patiently, "on every settled human planet in all the known universe, there is a free public clinic where stress reactions of any sort may be diagnosed, treated or prescribed for, speedily, effectively, and with dignity. I trust you will not regard it as an intrusion on your privacy if I make the admittedly non-professional observation (you see, I do not pretend to be a therapist) that there are times when a citizen is not himself aware that he is under stress, even though it may be clearly, perhaps painfully obvious to others. It would not be a discourtesy, would it, or an unkindness, for some understanding stranger to suggest to such a citizen that&mdash;"</div><div class='single-blockquote'>"What you're saying, all wrapped up in words, is I ought to go have my head candled."</div><div class='single-blockquote'>"By no means. I am not qualified. I did, however, think that a visit to a clinic&mdash;there's one just a step away from here&mdash;might make&mdash;ah&mdash;communications between us more possible. I would be glad to arrange another appointment for you, when you're feeling better. That is to say, when you are... ah..." He finished with a bleak smile and reached toward the calling stud.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Moving almost like a Drive-ship, Bux seemed to cease to exist on the visitor's chair and reappeared instantaneously at the side of the desk, a long thick arm extended and a meaty hand blocking the way to the stud. "Hear me out first," he said, softly. Really softly. It was a much more astonishing thing than if the Archive Master had trumpeted like an elephant. "Hear me out. Please."</div><div class='single-blockquote'>The old man withdrew his hand, but folded it with the other and set the neat stack of fingers on the edge of the desk. It looked like stubbornness.</div>

      <p>This story opening highlights a tried and true technique for building tension: put two diametrically opposed characters in a room and see what happens. Of course, this method makes an implicit promise to the reader&mdash;there is more than a surface-level difference between these characters. The reader expects that this tension is a harbinger of a conflict to come. <em>If All Men Were Brothers, Would You Let One Marry Your Sister</em> delivers on this promise. You can find it in the excellent 1967 anthology <em>Dangerous Visions</em>.</p>
