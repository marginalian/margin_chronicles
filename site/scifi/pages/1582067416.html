      <h1>What Came Before</h1>
      <p>One common way to provide the reader with more supporting information about the story is the flashback or analepsis. This is similar to <a target='' href='./1580270620.html'>using a flash-forward for exposition</a>.</p>
      <p>The following passage from "A Lingering Scent of Jasmine" by Pat Murphy provides us with a masterful example of an external analepsis, which flashes back to a time outside of the current narrative, as opposed to internal analepsis which flashes back to a time that the narrative has already covered.</p>
      <p><div class='long'><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">She watched him through half-closed eyes. She was sleek and poised in french jeans and a golden leotard, her hair tied up in a scarf with just a few strands floating free around her face.</div><div class="single-blockquote">She had not always been so confident. Tony had met Diane three years before, when she was a drama student, working part-time at the steakhouse that he managed. One afternoon, her car had refused to start and she was late for an audition. Tony had driven her to the audition and she had cried on his shoulder when the director gave the part to another girl. A week later, he celebrated with her when she got a part in another play. Eventually she moved into the house in the Berkeley hills. For two years, they had lived together happily. She had needed him then: for reassurance, for comfort.</div><div class="single-blockquote">He claimed that she had stopped loving him the day she was mentioned favorably in a review. She had changed: lost weight, learned to use makeup. She had turned into a slim-hipped, honey-tanned California girl with a laugh like the sound of Almaden Mountain Rhine wine pouring into a tumbler&mdash;sweet but a little vulgar. A lady with a mind like a racing car engine. Not a Swiss watch&mdash;this lady was built for power.</div><div class="single-blockquote">She had started bringing her actor friends home: people with names like Vancouver John and the Lizard King. That's when the fights started.</div><div class="single-blockquote">"You don't spend time with me anymore," he had complained. "You're too busy with your friends."</div><div class="single-blockquote">"That's not true and you know it. You're just feeling sorry for yourself. I'm doing things I want to do and you resent that. You wanted me to stay the way I was&mdash;a shy, weak, little girl. You wanted me to..."</div><div class="single-blockquote">"I wanted a woman I could love."</div><div class="single-blockquote">"You wanted a woman who wouldn't change."</div><div class="single-blockquote">When Diane got a chance to tour with a traveling company she and Tony agreed&mdash;in a reasonable, calm fashion&mdash;that their life together had come to an end.</div><div class="single-blockquote">Now she was back.</div>

      <p>There's a lot to love about this passage.</p>
      <p>First, as with any interruption in the main narrative, it's important to provide a clear signal to the reader. The sentence "she had not always been so confident" is the reader's clue that they're heading to the past.</p>
      <p>Since this passage is near the beginning of the overall story, we learn many new details without feeling like the writer is just dumping backstory on us. We learn that Tony manages a steak house. We learn that he is insecure and likes to feel needed. We see Diane transformation through his eyes. And we learn that things ended between them.</p>
      <p>Just as it's important to signal a departure from the narrative, it's also important to signal the return. Murphy does this well by placing the short, signaling sentence all on its own: "Now she was back."</p>
