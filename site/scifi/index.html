      <h1>Micro</h1>
      <p>Notes on sentence and inter-sentence style. Finishing touches, like similes and word choice, happen at the micro level.</p><ul>
      <li><a target='' href='./pages/1577983858.html'>The Care and Handling of Throwaway Characters</a></li>

      <h1>Meso</h1>
      <p>Notes on how different sections of the story support each other. This section also examines the transitions between sections (analepses, prolepses, scene breaks, et al).</p>
      <h2>Tension</h2><ul>
      <li><a target='' href='./pages/1584284992.html'>Character v Character: Tension, Done Well</a></li></ul>
      <h2>Setting the Scene</h2>
      <p>No story can survive on dialogue and action alone. The reader needs to have a world in their mind's eye, before a writer can start to fill that world with witty starship captains and enigmatic aliens. Conventionally, short stories and early novel chapters begin with descriptions of the setting.</p><ul>
      <li><a target='' href='./pages/1578083491.html'>Pairing Description with Action</a></li></ul>
      <h2>Exposing Exposition</h2>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote"><em>Exposition</em> is the explanation of events or circumstances not given narrative or dramatic treatment in the story. Sometimes referred to as the "expository lump"&mdash;because, I suppose, it is so hard for the reader to swallow if presented clumsily.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Paragons - Robin Wilson</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>A speculative story's plot is often driven by a novel idea: future technologies, strange natural events, etc. The writer must make extra efforts to describe these ideas clearly without boring the reader.</p><ul>
      <li><a target='' href='./pages/1580270620.html'>Future Exposition, Now</a></li>
      <li><a target='' href='./pages/1582067416.html'>What Came Before</a></li></ul>
      <p>Sometimes it's impossible to avoid adding a giant block of exposition into the narrative. In these cases, look for ways to keep the passage interesting. <div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">I've always tried to avoid infodumps; when I can't see any way to avoid them, I try to make them less boring by inserting them into a more dramatic context. So a first draft conversation around a conference table ends up taking place during an invasive and painful decontamination procedure in the final version. Someone who starts off pondering the biochemistry of a certain microbe while sitting in a chair might, by the time the book makes it into print, find herself being forced to work through the same questions under torture. Anything to avoid endless pages of talking heads spouting facts at each other.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Starfish and Sunflowers: A Conversation with Peter Watts - Peter Watts (interviewer: Arley Sorg)</div>
