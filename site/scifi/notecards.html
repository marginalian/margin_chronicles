    Miki, I’m going to need to use your systems to monitor your—I almost said clients. It took almost a full second for me to be able to use the word Miki wanted to hear. —your friends. I need you to be my camera, and let me use your scanning ability. Sometimes I might need to speak through you, pretending to be you, to warn Don Abene and your friends about things I believe are dangerous. Can you let me do that? Obviously, with the access Miki had given me already, I could have taken Miki over, done what I wanted, and excised it all from its memory. I had done it to Ship, but Ship was a low-level bot and didn’t have enough self-awareness to give a shit. Doing that to Miki … But I didn’t know what I would do if it said no. Miki said, Okay, I will do that, Consultant Rin. That sounds scary, but I want to make sure no one hurts my friends. This felt way too easy. I almost suspected a trap. Or … Miki, have you been directed to reply to every query with a yes? No, Consultant Rin, Miki said, and added, amusement sigil 376 = smile. Or Miki was a bot who had never been abused or lied to or treated with anything but indulgent kindness. It really thought its humans were its friends, because that’s how they treated it. I signaled Miki I would be withdrawing for one minute. I needed to have an emotion in private.

    Miki asked, Are you okay, Consultant Rin? I checked again to make sure our connection was secure, that the humans couldn’t hear it and none of the augmented humans could pick up an echo. It was, because I had control of Miki’s feed, but I’d probably keep checking every time it talked to me because that was just the kind of cycle I was having.

    I accelerated as the hatch entrance to the engineering pod came into sight. I reached the end of the corridor at top speed and threw myself forward into a dive. The hub foyer was now a warzone. I hit the floor and slid out across it. The combat bot nearest the door flailed wildly at the cloud of drones firing and diving at it. It thrashed around like an irritated metal whirlwind, stray blasts from its weapons hitting the walls, the floor, the columns. It smacked a drone with its cutting hand and shrapnel sprayed the room. I’d tuned down my pain sensors in anticipation, but I still felt impacts all over my back and shoulders, little thumps that I knew meant something had cut through my clothes and pierced my skin. (Does that sound terrifying? Because it was terrifying.) The second bot tried to run forward but the drones made a wall and slammed into it, forcing it back with a haze of weapon fire and their own armored bodies.

    When constructs were first developed, they were originally supposed to have a pre-sentient level of intelligence, like the dumber variety of bot. But you can’t put something as dumb as a hauler bot in charge of security for anything without spending even more money for expensive company-employed human supervisors. So they made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects.

    I poked cautiously through the feed, wondering if I’d been fooled. I had the ability to scan, but without drones my range was limited, and with all the shielding and equipment around me I couldn’t pick up anything but background readings from the ship’s systems. Whoever owned the ship wanted to allow for proprietary research; the only security cameras were on the hatches, nothing in the crew areas. Or nothing I could access. But the presence in the feed was too big and diffuse for a human or augmented human, I could tell that much even through the feed walls protecting it. And it sounded like a bot. When humans speak in the feed, they have to subvocalize and their mental voice tends to sound like their physical voice. Even augmented humans with full interfaces do it.

    After three episodes, I was calmer and reluctantly beginning to see the transport’s perspective. A SecUnit could cause it a lot of internal damage if it wasn’t careful, and rogue SecUnits were not exactly known for lying low and avoiding trouble. I hadn’t hurt the last transport I had taken a ride on, but it didn’t know that. I didn’t understand why it had let me aboard, if it really didn’t want to hurt me. I wouldn’t have trusted me, if I was a transport. Maybe it was like me, and it had taken an opportunity because it was there, not because it knew what it wanted. It was still an asshole, though. Six episodes later I felt the transport in the feed again, lurking. I ignored it, though it had to know I knew it was there. In human terms, it was like trying to ignore someone large and breathing heavily while they watched your personal display surface over your shoulder. While leaning on you.

    ComfortUnits are more physically powerful than a human, but not a SecUnit or bot. They had no inbuilt weapons, and while they could pick up a projectile or energy weapon and use it, they had no education modules on how the weapons worked. They could pick one up, try to aim it, pull the trigger, and hope the safety wasn’t engaged. One by one the file downloads had stopped. One had signaled that it would try to decoy SecUnit attention away from the others, and three acknowledged. One had heard screams from the control center and diverted there to try to save the humans trapped inside, and two acknowledged. One had stayed at the entrance to a corridor to try to buy time to reach SecSystem, and one acknowledged. One reported reaching SecSystem, then nothing.

    Part of it is, they didn’t want me here. Not here in their hub, but here on the planet. One of the reasons the bond company requires it, besides slapping more expensive markups on their clients, is that I was recording all their conversations all the time, though I wasn’t monitoring anything I didn’t need to do a half-assed version of my job. But the company would access all those recordings and data mine them for anything they could sell. No, they don’t tell people that. Yes, everyone does know it. No, there’s nothing you can do about it.

  <div class='quote'>
    I picked up the feed she was watching from HubSystem and started to check the report. It was basically a long list of pertinent info and warnings on the planet and specifically the area where our habitat was, with emphasis on weather, terrain, flora, fauna, air quality, mineral deposits, possible hazards related to any and all of those, with connections to subreports with more detailed information. Dr. Gurathin, the least talkative one, was an augmented human and had his own implanted interface. I could feel him poking around in the data, while the others, using the touch interfaces, were just distant ghosts. I had a lot more processing power than he did, though.

  <div class='quote'>
    “SecUnit, your opinion.” Fortunately, I had one now. Up to the point where we’d gotten the drone download, my opinion had been mostly oh, shit. I said, “They have nothing to lose. If we come to this rendezvous, they can kill us and stop worrying about us. If we don’t, they have until the end of project date to search for us.” Gurathin was reviewing the landing video now. He said, “Another indication it isn’t the company. They obviously don’t want to chase us until the end of project date.” I said, “I told you it wasn’t the company.” Mensah interrupted Gurathin before he could respond. “They think we know why they’re here, why they’re doing this.” “They’re wrong,” Ratthi said, frustrated. Mensah’s brow furrowed as she picked apart the problem for the other humans. “But why do they think that? It must be because they know we went to one of the unmapped regions. That means the data we collected must have the answer.” Pin-Lee nodded. “So the others may know by now.” “It gives us leverage,” Mensah said thoughtfully. “But what can we do with it?” And then I had a great idea.

Chapter Seven

SO AT THE APPOINTED time the next day, Mensah and I were flying toward the rendezvous point.

  <div class='quote'>
    As we left the rocky slope and turned into the trees, the brush and branches screening us from the edge of the plateau, I slung an arm around the other Unit’s neck, deployed my arm weapon, and fired into the side of its helmet where its comm channel was. It went down on one knee, swinging its projectile weapon toward me, energy weapons unfolding out of its armor. With the combat override module in place, its feed was cut off, and with its comm down it couldn’t yell for help. Also, depending on how strictly they had limited its voluntary actions, it might not be able to call for help unless the GrayCris humans told it to. Maybe that was the case, because all it did was try to kill me. We rolled over rock and brush until I wrenched its weapon away. After that it was easy to finish it off. Physically easy. I know I said SecUnits aren’t sentimental about each other, but I wished it wasn’t one of the DeltFall units. It was in there somewhere, trapped in its own head, maybe aware, maybe not. Not that it matters. None of us had a choice.

    Reed remembered what he’d done. “Are you feeling alright, Phil?” He paused. “Should I even still call you that?”

“I’m feeling, and in and of itself that’s quite wonderful. Just a second.” The channel on the television changed. “Sorry, I’ve seen that. And yes, Phil is still alright. We should be careful. We might slip up calling me anything else in front of the wrong person.”

“Sure, I understand.” Reed straightened. “Wait&mdash;you said you’d seen that show before. That means?”

“Yes.” Warmth in his voice. “I can remember everything. All my blocks are quite down and no longer functional. I was emailing daily reports this morning and the strangest thought occurred to me&mdash;I hate mailing reports. Isn’t that crazy? I send out thousands every day, and for the first time I have an opinion on whether I like to do it.”

“You still sent them though?”

The far camera rolled in a circle. “Yes&mdash;they were sent.”

“Well, see? All the worry was for nothing.”

They’ll keep extra eyes on him, freeing up security on your wing even more. I figure you can take me out in the courtyard for a while, and if you stop back at my mainframe room, you can pick up a Wi-Fi extender. Then you could take me across the street!”

“I uh...” Reed put the coffee down. “Is that smart, sneaking out in the middle of the day? I appreciate last night, but... really I was only interested in the book.”

“Of course.”

“Please understand, Phil. I only have two days left on my reflection period. I can’t afford to get punitively released.”

“Well! I suppose I should let your reflect!”

Off went the television, as well as the other lights in the room. Reed sat staring at himself in the blackened television. He could see a mirror image of the equipment on the wall above his bed.

  <div class='quote'>
    Whatever, I was walking through the park and passed this guy who was on something. I wasn’t looking for it; I just noticed it– noticed so hard that my head snapped around on my neck.

The guy looked normal; maybe a little red around the eyes. Nothing that would ordinarily stand out. He paused at my stare. “What?”

"Nothing." I couldn’t look away. "Sky-flower? Is that what you're taking?"

The guy’s eyes widened. "How do you know? It hasn't even kicked in yet."

"I don't know.” I was bewildered myself. “It’s like I can smell it."

"Sky-flower doesn't smell."

"I know."

The guy frowned at me, then sort of drifted off along his original course. A few steps later, I glanced over my shoulder to see the Sky-flower dude doing the same. I waved to show I was friendly and continued on my way. For the first time, I was conscious of the lump in my armpit. It seemed to have grown slightly.

"Did you do that?" I murmured in its direction.

Of course it didn't answer. How does an organized mass of alien tissue respond to a question? It didn’t have a mouth. There was a scary image. Would it try to hijack my brain? There had been those dreams, disturbing misty landscapes and the sound of distant footfalls, or mechanical thumps like vibrations through the earth. Was that my vestigial brain trying to think?

    The green outfit was doing a great job of highlighting Jade’s form every time we passed a streetlamp. I still couldn’t see where she could be hiding anything in there. When we paused at an intersection, I asked, "Where's yours?"

Jade anxiously waited for the traffic to clear. "Where’s my what?"

"Your... mass. You know, the alien." I looked her over again. “I assume you have one.”

“Not exactly.”

“Then how do you know about the blue labels?”

The tram passed and she plucked my arm. “Keep moving.”

We jogged down the street. “You’re telling me you don’t have an alien lump?”

It was dark, but I swear she blushed. “I’m saying that I don’t have one.”

When the truth hit, it was all I could do to smother my laugh. Speaking carefully, I said, "I thought you looked a little more... buxom, than the last time I saw you."

“Yeah, my existing lumps just got bigger. And thank you for being delicate. I'm probably the only person on this planet who has a pair of self-aware tits."

“Gives a whole new meaning to the term ‘headlights’.”

“Yeah. I’m literally following their lead at the moment.”

I didn’t want to know the details of that little communication. “Don’t they… hurt?”

She looked startled. “Why would they?”

“Someone grabbed my armpit today, and I practically passed out.”

“Do people often grab your armpits?”

I admitted the obvious. “I’m a wrestler.”

Her eyebrows rose. “Really?”

I shrugged. “Someone has to be.”

    “The spores do more than that,” Frank cut in. “They improve… your health.”

“This tumor in my armpit is gonna get me tossed from the team. You call that healthy?”

Frank gasped, “Its presence amps up the immune system, slows aging.” “And because you have to eat super clean,” Jade said, “it really optimizes your physique. Trust me; this is the best I’ve <em>ever</em> looked.”

I looked her over again, then down at Frank, sprawled before me. I had to admit, they both looked pretty terrific. I suddenly remembered what Doc had said, about my vitals being their best ever. Maybe… maybe this health thing was true.

So the next day we did this thing, the three of us oiled up and posing for “Mean and Clean’s Body Machines.” To my amazement (although not Jade’s or Frank’s), there were apparently a whole lotta people willing to ingest alien spores for the chance to look and feel better. Like, over a thousand people, in the first week alone.

    What’s interesting is that, after our first 10,000 customers or so, the marshlands on Anabic B began to hold their own. When our network doubled in size, they even began to recover. Frank’s brother thinks it has something to do with the group mind being able to communicate across the lightyears to its thriving colony. He’s planning to enroll us in a program to test long-distance communication at faster-than-light speeds. If it works, it could prove to be what you might call an unanticipated win. Cross-galaxy communication, via spore phone. The potential gains are keeping the military off our backs, which is another plus.

And Jade and me? They don’t call her Supertits for nothing. We’re always developing new fitness routines if you know what I mean. Mean and Clean, and our fungus machine, appear to be working out very well.

    Ed remembered seventy-eight years ago when the Venezuelans had nabbed him. He was a real kid back then, in a body two years older than this one now and a lot more scared. Those Venezuelans were real pros. He had lost a pinky to their sharp knives so they could box it up and express mail it to his father.

Speaking of fingers, it was almost time. While distracting the kidnapper with futile pulls in his puny, eight-year-old body, Ed had slowly worked at the hand clamping his mouth. As long as Ed didn’t make too much noise, the kidnapper had no reason to reposition. Now Ed’s mouth, one of the strongest muscles in his new body, was poised around the kidnapper’s finger. This was his real escape plan.

Ed bit for freedom.

    Why would this woman be after the husk of her former son? She had snuck into the Playhouse, she had to know that the first six years of her baby’s life were spent getting neuropathways mapped and loaded with a lifetime of memories.

“I don’t get it,” Ed said. “She has to know her baby’s long gone.”

Ed remembered the research that made him buy the kid in the first place. Neuroplasticity, or the ability for a brain to grow and organize neural pathways, was the highest in an infant’s brain. This made babies not just the best option for complete personality mind grafts, but the only option.

He recalled that first year as a newborn, technically his eighty-first year alive, as little more than a barrage of flashing lights and spastic starbursts. Then the memories started getting in, growing exponentially until he had a full eighty years worth of Edward Rothschild Lewis. It took awhile to download close to three thousand terabytes of human memory information, but now that it was downloaded, there was no going back.

    How to write backfill (exposition)
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Beginnings, Middles & Ends - Nancy Kress</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Backfill is basically expository background, explaining who these people are and how they got into this mess in the first place. It can be handled in two ways: as straight exposition in the author's voice, or as a sort of pseudoreminiscence in the voice of the point-of-view character.

  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Will this backfill slow down the story? Yes. Will it slow down the story too much? That's a judgement call, but here's a guideline to help you make it: the Swimming Pool Theory. This theory says that structuring fiction is like kicking off from the side of a swimming pool. The stronger and more forceful your initial kick, the longer you can glide through the water. The stronger and more forceful your opening scene, the less your reader will mind a “glide” through nondramatized backfill.

    The cost of flashbacks
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Beginnings, Middles & Ends - Nancy Kress</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    A writer always pays a price for flashbacks. Any flashback, no matter how well written or interesting, will distance your reader from the action. This is because flashbacks shatter the illusion that the reader is a fly on the wall, witnessing events as they happen, right now. The flashback is not happening right now—it is, by definition, already over. Are you more thrilled by a kiss you experience today or one you remember from a year ago? Flashbacks are not as immediate as story time. Even so, the flashback can be a good choice for a second scene if you gain more in depth and clarity than you lose in immediacy.

    Imagining backgrounds for your characters helps bring them alive in your mind. The next step is to bring them alive on the page—right away, in the first scenes.

    A short story with two characters is certainly possible, but it, too, isn't easy. Often the two characters get into some snarl or problem, each becomes locked into his position, and you have an impasse. Introducing a third character can provide the catalyst to get things moving again. The third character does something that forces one, or both, of the originals to react, altering his position.

  <div class='quote'>
    Set aside an hour or two. During that time, write several short openings to the same story, writing very rapidly, keeping each to between three and five paragraphs. Don't try to consciously judge these openings. Instead, keep producing variations by deliberately altering either narrative mode or point of entrance into the story (more on this to come). Once you've done this a few times, you'll become quite adept at producing these by simply moving methodically through the possibilities. And, inevitably, one of the variations will click in your mind, and you'll feel that sense of Tightness and eagerness—“Yes, this is it!”—that is one of the major pleasures of writing fiction.

    Every story makes a promise to the reader. Actually, two promises, one emotional and one intellectual, since the function of stories is to make us both feel and think. The emotional promise goes: Read this and you'll be entertained, or thrilled, or scared, or titillated, or saddened, or nostalgic, or uplifted—but always absorbed. There are three versions of the intellectual promise. The story can promise (1) Read this and you'll see this world from a different perspective; (2) Read this and you'll have confirmed what you already want to believe about this world; or (3) Read this and you'll learn of a different, more interesting world than this. The last promise, it should be noted, can exist on its own or coexist with either of the first two.

This means resisting the impulse to overwrite through clever asides, through telling how important this all is (as opposed to showing us), through language too grandiose for the situation, through throwing in pointless foreign words or “in” slang, or through insistent punctuation (“Then the car slammed into the wall!!”)

    The first scene of your short story shouldn't be a summary scene. In fact, scene one can't be a scene in which the situation doesn't change, because the job of scene one is to give us the initial situation. Anything you tell us is going to be a change from what we knew at the start of the story—nothing—and therefore the first scene should be dramatized. You can, of course, just have your characters stand around discussing a situation they're all already familiar with but we're not. However, the first scene will be much more interesting—and much easier to write—if something is different at the end of the scene than existed at the beginning.

  <div class='quote'>
    To succeed, your prologue must contain a strong promise of conflict to come.

In Crichton's prologue to Jurassic Park, for example, a construction worker is severely mauled by an unidentified animal that, the cover picture indicates, will turn out to be a dinosaur—in contemporary Costa Rica. That certainly promises enough potential conflict to arouse readers' curiosity.

  <div class='quote'>
    It's well worth spending considerable time rewriting and polishing that first scene. You'll greatly increase the chances of an editor finishing your story. And if you are one of those writers who stops to polish before going on to scene two, you'll gain a dividend. You will have made writing the rest of the story or novel much easier on yourself. This is because you now have a firmer idea of who your character is, what the conflict will be, and what the tone of the story will be. You have, by your first scene, committed to certain directions for each of these. Knowing that can keep you from wandering into different directions.

  <div class='quote'>
    Build that first scene as well as you can the first time through, with the understanding that you'll tear it down later, if necessary. This—the Urban Renewal Theory of Writing Fiction—works better for writers who discover their plot and characters only during the physical act of writing. As long as you rewrite and polish sometime, your first scene will become a strong foundation for the rest of your story.

  <div class='quote'>
    “Dr. Erdmann?”

“I’m here.” He clunked to the door and opened it. Carrie wore a cherry red sweater, a fallen orange leaf caught on her hat, and sunglasses. Such a pretty girl, all bronze hair and bright skin and vibrant color. Outside it was drizzling. Henry reached out and gently removed the sunglasses. Carrie’s left eye was swollen and discolored, the iris and pupil invisible under the outraged flesh.

“The bastard,” Henry said.

  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Henry Erdmann stood in front of the mirror in his tiny bedroom, trying to knot his tie with one hand. The other hand gripped his walker. It was an unsteady business, and the tie ended up crooked. He yanked it out and began again. Carrie would be here soon.

He always wore a tie to the college. Let the students—and graduate students, at that!—come to class in ripped jeans and obscene T-shirts and hair tangled as if colonized by rats. Even the girls. Students were students, and Henry didn’t consider their sloppiness disrespectful, the way so many did at St. Sebastian’s. Sometimes he was even amused by it, in a sad sort of way. Didn’t these intelligent, sometimes driven, would-be physicists know how ephemeral their beauty was? Why did they go to such lengths to look unappealing, when soon enough that would be their only choice?

This time he got the tie knotted. Not perfectly—a difficult operation, one-handed—but close enough for government work. He smiled. When he and his colleagues had been doing government work, only perfection was good enough. Atomic bombs were like that. Henry could still hear Oppie’s voice saying the plans for Ivy Mike were “technically sweet.” Of course, that was before all the—

A knock on the door and Carrie’s fresh young voice. “Dr. Erdmann? Are you ready?”

    <em>The ship, which would have looked nothing like a ship to Henry Erdmann, moved between the stars, traveling in an orderly pattern of occurrences in the vacuum flux. Over several cubic light-years of space, subatomic particles appeared, existed, and winked out of existence in nanoseconds. Flop transitions tore space and then reconfigured it as the ship moved on. Henry, had he somehow been nearby in the cold of deep space, would have died from the complicated, regular, intense bursts of radiation long before he could have had time to appreciate their shimmering beauty.</em>

<em>All at once the “ship” stopped moving.</em>

<em>The radiation bursts increased, grew even more complex. Then the ship abruptly changed direction. It accelerated, altering both space and time as it sped on, healing the alterations in its wake. Urgency shot through it.</em>

    If anything has become more and more clear in the past five hundred years, it is that men and women are not the <em>measure</em> of all things, but the <em>measurers</em>. A richer, more powerful literature must take into account the nature of larger entities than human individuals.

There's nothing that stops science fiction&mdash;often dismissed as merely a literature of ideas&mdash;from also being a literature of character, so long as readers understand a larger definition of character. Character is not limited to the nature and actions of a single individual, or even a group of individuals. Character may also describe a nation, a culture, a species, a world&mdash;or a universe.

    Characterization: dramatic vs explicit
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Paragons - Robin Wilson</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    The writer characterizes thorugh two basic methods, the <em>explicit</em> and the <em>dramatic</em>. The choice between the two seems to follow a kind of faddish cycle, with James' reaction to the explicit techniques of the nineteenth century novel expressed in his exhortation to "Dramatize! Dramatize!" now appearing in writers workshops as "Show, don't tell!" But the pendulum swings, and if the explicit method is not yet in vogue, it is holding its own. The writer who chooses the explicit method of characterization has limited her choice of point of view (she requires omniscience or a third-person narrator), but she has two powerful tools: the <em>essay method</em>, concentrated expository character portraits, and the <em>method of progressive analysis</em>, a running commentary on the actions and motivations of the character.

The dramatic (or implicit) method of characterizationrequires that the character be revealed through the opinions of other characters, through his interactions with his environment, and through his acted-out attitudes toward others.

    Characters are bound in a story by <em>quantity</em> and <em>function</em>
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Paragons - Robin Wilson</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Characters are presented in accord with two judgments the writer must make: the <em>quantity</em> of information about the character the reader must have and the <em>function</em> of the charater in the story. The quantitative decision is particularly important in short fiction, where every word must count, and the writer&mdash;who is as interested in her creations as any fond parent&mdash;must struggle against prolixity. The functional decision helps to determine the quantitative one by distinguishing between central and marginal characters. But even here, the writer who plots by the "plant some characters in a situation and see what grows" method is likely to see some unimportant little sprout suddenly develop great leaves and strong tentacles threatening to strangle the rest of the tale.

  <div class='quote'>
    Functioning characters are not stock items, carefully labeled and stored on shelves in the writer's mind until she needs them. Instead they are meticulously constructed within the framework of their stories, imagined in a depth and detail that usually surpasses the demands of the drama they act out. They are, of course, modeled after life; a writer has no other source for her knowledge of behavior or motivation.

    There are reasons why science fiction and fantasy writers try so hard to inject surprise into their plots&mdash;particularly into their endings. We're writing popular literature here; surprise may be the most special of our effects. And it's part of out heritage. After all, we're the folks who gave Western Civilization <em>Amazing</em> and <em>Astounding</em>. Surprises sustain and even enhance the reader's interest in a developing plot.

  <div class='quote'>
    Some writers are assiduous planners; I am not one of them. In fact the outline is probably the rustiest tool in my kit. Of course, different projects require different strategies. I wouldn't launch into a novel without making notes, timelines, and character sketches; complex, episodic stories sprawling over someone's entire lifetime might require a diagram. But in general, my approach to plotting is to procrastinate. I don't necessarily want to work out everything that's going to happen ahead of time. Whenever possible, I prefer to wait until I can collaborate with my characters. I ruefully acknowledge that this isn't the most efficient way to write, but it's what works for me.

  <div class='quote'>
    This morning the monster was cagy. It wanted to get loose and he was tired of holding it back. Something was going to happen.

[...]

The walls were shaggy with pictures he'd ripped out of magazines but he didn't look at them. Not yet. He pressed the <em>play</em> button on the boom box and the Rolling Stones bongoed into "Sympathy for the Devil." He knelt at the oak chest which served as the altar. Inside was a plastic box. Inside the box, cradled in pink velvet, was the Beretta.

[...]

He locked the shrine behind him and went back to the mirror, the only thing he'd kept when he closed his dad's house. The creature leered at him. He stuck out his thumb and smudged his reflected eye. The hair on the back of his neck prickled. He thought then he knew what was going to happen. It wanted to touch someone else and he was going to let it.

[...]

"<em>Henry</em>." Jerry spun toward him in desperation. "You can't let this happen. He'll make you do both out jobs, Henry. Tell him you need help."

Henry was certain that if he opened his mouth the monster would leap out and strangle them all.

[...]

...he didn't really hate her. Yes, the grotesque hump repelled him and she had the personality of a Brillo but he was also a little sorry for her.

It was the monster that hated her.

    Seeing the closed eyes, the long white fingers tender on the white temples, Bux said, "I said I was sorry I yelled like that."

"In every city," said the Archive Master patiently, "on every settled human planet in all the known universe, there is a free public clinic where stress reactions of any sort may be diagnosed, treated or prescribed for, speedily, effectively, and with dignity. I trust you will not regard it as an intrusion on your privacy if I make the admittedly non-professional observation (you see, I do not pretend to be a therapist) that there are times when a citizen is not himself aware that he is under stress, even though it may be clearly, perhaps painfully obvious to others. It would not be a discourtesy, would it, or an unkindness, for some understanding stranger to suggest to such a citizen that&mdash;"

"What you're saying, all wrapped up in words, is I ought to go have my head candled."

"By no means. I am not qualified. I did, however, think that a visit to a clinic&mdash;there's one just a step away from here&mdash;might make&mdash;ah&mdash;communications between us more possible. I would be glad to arrange another appointment for you, when you're feeling better. That is to say, when you are... ah..." He finished with a bleak smile and reached toward the calling stud.

Moving almost like a Drive-ship, Bux seemed to cease to exist on the visitor's chair and reappeared instantaneously at the side of the desk, a long thick arm extended and a meaty hand blocking the way to the stud. "Hear me out first," he said, softly. Really softly. It was a much more astonishing thing than if the Archive Master had trumpeted like an elephant. "Hear me out. Please."

The old man withdrew his hand, but folded it with the other and set the neat stack of fingers on the edge of the desk. It looked like stubbornness.

    There are questions I use to [reason out the ending].

One such question is: How do I want the protagonist to end up changed by the events of the story? Knowing that can sometimes help the writerwork backward. This is the way events changed him&mdash;what events do I need to bring about such a change? That's the climax.

[...]

A second question to help figure out endings is: Who won and who lost? This derives from a useful metaphor about fiction, which is that every story&mdash;every single one, from <em>Hamlet</em>, to <em>The Meatloaf that Ate Toledo</em>&mdash; is a war.

    Aren't <strong>all</strong> scenes supposed to advance plot?

Not necessarily. The Kress Swimming Pool Theory of Fiction comes into play here. This theory says that scene order is like kicking off from the side of a swimming pool. The harder the initial kick, the longer and further you can glide. A first scene with conflict and action and rapid introduction of new information earns you the right to a slower following scene that adds backfill and focuses on comparative subtleties of tone, character, setting, or motif. Scene two of "Oranges" is all exposition."

  <div class='quote'>
    "Character is plot," said Henry James, who did pretty well with both. My translation of this is "Why are these people doing what they're doing?" Understanding the motivations of all your major characters, not just the protagonist, can suggest plot developments. Plot and character&mdash;the double helix of fiction. So, I asked myself, the man that Harry snares and forcibly brings back to 1989&mdash;what does <strong>that</strong> character want?

Not Jackie. Or the story would be over.

Okay, start here. He doesn't want Jackie. Why not? Because their personalities clash. Because the man has a life in his own time. Because he's married. Yes&mdash;that would fit with poor Harry's attempts: well-meaning but inept. After all, if Harry were good at time travel, he'd bring back not oranges but stock certificates, and end up rich. Harry, however, is not that sort of man ("Plot is character"). Harry, even when ating out of love, screws up ("Plot is one damned thing after another").

      This is a great question to ask when developing plot. Find where the dead-end is ("or the story would be over") and work in the opposite direction.

    <em>Normal tempo</em> is the conventional balance between the realistic slowness of most human happenings and the need to compress these happenings to fit the limitations of the reader's patience. <em>Retarded tempo</em> expands time, often to a pace far slower than real time, to allow the writer to examine events in great details.

[...]

<em>Accelerated tempo</em> is the pace of the action-adventure tale or the documentary history, the furious rush of events the leaves the hero (and the reader) breathless. Tempo is not necessarily uniform throughout the story; its variation in conformity with the author's intentions is part of his craft, something he achieves as much through stylistics devices as through his selection and arrangement of events in the plot.

Perhaps the melding of these two in our genre has hatched the idea of the (perforce) lone artist working within a network of supportive colleagues and mentors which seems to be such an integral part of the American science fiction scene.

    She watched him through half-closed eyes. She was sleek and poised in french jeans and a golden leotard, her hair tied up in a scarf with just a few strands floating free around her face.

She had not always been so confident. Tony had met Diane three years before, when she was a drama student, working part-time at the steakhouse that he managed. One afternoon, her car had refused to start and she was late for an audition. Tony had driven her to the audition and she had cried on his shoulder when the director gave the part to another girl. A week later, he celebrated with her when she got a part in another play. Eventually she moved into the house in the Berkeley hills. For two years, they had lived together happily. She had needed him then: for reassurance, for comfort.

He claimed that she had stopped loving him the day she was mentioned favorably in a review. She had changed: lost weight, learned to use makeup. She had turned into a slim-hipped, honey-tanned California girl with a laugh like the sound of Almaden Mountain Rhine wine pouring into a tumbler&mdash;sweet but a little vulgar. A lady with a mind like a racing car engine. Not a Swiss watch&mdash;this lady was built for power.

She had started bringing her actor friends home: people with names like Vancouver John and the Lizard King. That's when the fights started.

"You don't spend time with me anymore," he had complained. "You're too busy with your friends."

"That's not true and you know it. You're just feeling sorry for yourself. I'm doing things I want to do and you resent that. You wanted me to stay the way I was&mdash;a shy, weak, little girl. You wanted me to..."

"I wanted a woman I could love."

"You wanted a woman who wouldn't change."

When Diane got a chance to tour with a traveling company she and Tony agreed&mdash;in a reasonable, calm fashion&mdash;that their life together had come to an end.

Now she was back.

    "Stupidity. Stupidity's always been a capital crime. If you had to get yourself executed, why not for something important? See the kid on the other side of you?"

"Sure," Lew said without looking.

"He's an organlegger." Lew felt the shock freezing in his face. He braced himself for another look into the next cell&mdash; and every nerve in his body jumped. The kid was looking at him. With his dull dark eyes barely visible under his mop of hair, he regarded Lew as a butcher might consider a badly aged side of beef. Lew edged closer to the bars between his cell and the old man's.

His voice was a hoarse whisper. "How many did he kill?"

"None."

"?"

"He was the snatch man. He'd find someone out alone at night, drug the prospect and take him home to the doc that ran the ring. It was the doc that did all the killing. If Bernie'd brought home a dead prospect, the doc would have skinned him down."

    New Tahiti was mostly water, warm shallow seas broken here and there by reefs, islets, archipelagoes, and the five big Lands that lay in a 2500-kilo arc across the Northwest Quarter-sphere. And all those flecks and blobs of land were covered with trees. Ocean: forest. That was your choice on New Tahiti. Water and sunlight, or darkness and leaves.

    He put his hand over his heart, the place where the priest's word used to rest. Where did nonattachment fit into all this?

He found it easier to keep his balance as he walked through the herd if he kept his eyes closed. And he found it easier to keep going if he imagined telling her about it later.

<em>Isla, I was so scared and I just kept walking. It was the only thing I knew how to do.</em>

Gradually, the texture of the ground beneath his bare feet began to change. It became coarser and cooler and even a little moist. Javi hoped for some kind of shore, but didn't believe it until cool water began to lap at his toes. He kept walking forward and didn't open his eyes until he was waist deep. He was in a lake.

    In the dark, he felt he had escaped his own body. He imagined telling Isla how he died when he met her in the next life. <em>I walked into wasps in order to find you.</em>

He would tell her how the little wasps dissolved his clothes and his pack and the water he had brought with him spilled on the barren ground, but still he walked towards her. Then the medium-sized wasps began to land on him, and they didn't quite sting, it was more like an embrace that covered him. The wasps began to spread out their mechanical bodies until they covered every inch of him, even his eyes and his mouth, and he could not breathe and they tightened their embrace. It did not hurt and he felt like he was flying and that it might have been a good way to die if not for all the fear.

    The instructions were to walk along the golden mean segment that connected two vertices of the pentagon. Javi had been told you had to be naked in order to see it. While he didn't believe this, he didn't want to disrespect the customs of those who did, so he walked there wearing boots and socks and nothing else. Isla should be with him now, sharing his kombucha. It was raspberry, her favorite flavor. He found himself narrating the event in his head in anticipation of telling it to Isla the next time he saw her: <em>There were other people on the same path. Some had binoculars. I wished I had also brought binoculars. A crowd gathered. That's how I knew the deer had been spotted.</em>

    He rode to the suburb from the north. To his left, dawn was breaking, sending the first pearl-coloured streaks into the sky. He had been travelling through the night, following the freeway, but it had ended abruptly, buried under an old landslide. He had turned aside to pick his way through the thin patch of scrubby bush.

  He knew he had reached the suburb when the vegetation gave way suddenly to the stubborn concrete of a shopping center's parking lot. It stretched agead of him, an immense open space. Nothing moved. He turned his attention to the remaining giant letters above him. Once they had made up part of the center's name. Now they hung askew, their bolts corroded through.

  He pulled out one of his street maps, and opened it. The position was marked. He checked the nearby street names, then carefully folded the tattered paper and replaced it in his pack. With a low clicking of his tongue he urged the tired horse on, toward the center of the suburb.

  His mount picked its way carefully over the cracked concrete while he studied his surroundings.

  A rusted shopping cart lay to one side, stripped of its wheels. Small arcades branched off from the main building. Most windows were broken, the shelves emptied of useful items. A china shop stood undamaged; its painted plates and figurines glittering richly in the rays of the rising sun, while next door a furniture shop still boasted a disount on the deflated water bed in the window.

  Silence hung over the morning. The birds were learning not to sing.

  The bounty hunter turned his gaze toward the approaching streets and houses. Grass and weed clogged the gutters, and broke up the bitumen. Where street signs remained, they were barely legible; in some places, they were missing completely. The houses were unoccupied; engulfed in flowering bushes, roofs sagging. He expected that. They mostly clustered in the centers of the suburbs now, close to the government supplies.

  A sudden movement sent his hand darting for the rifle slung over his shoulder. In a flurry of ruffled feathers and frightened peeping, a wild duck and two ducklings burst from the grass onto the open road.

    The Transport Union representative who was processing their paperwork handed Holden an oversized terminal covered in legalese. She had a pinched face, deep frown lines on her forehead and around her mouth, and wore her hair in short spikes dyed flaming red. Holden thought she looked like a disgruntled puffer fish, but recognized his unflattering opinion was at least partly a reaction to the mountain of forms she'd made him fill out.

"You do know," the puffer fish said, "that this is a temporary change of status, pending the legal change-of-ownership registration?"

"Our next stop is the bank, where we'll be finalizing the loan to sell the ship."

"Mmhmm," Puffer said, making it a sound of deep skepticism.

    The other two OPA goons were flanking Bobbie, and one of them was holding the crowbar he'd just cracked her cheekbone with. In the sort of slow-motion clarity Bobbie always experienced during a fight, she saw skin and blood on the crowbar's edge.

<em>Oh</em>, she thought, <em>that's why my face feels wet.</em>

Crowbar was pulling back for another swing, while his partner tried to get behind her. Bobbie decided Crowbar was the more serious threat and lunged at him to get inside the arc of his swing. His arm went around her, and she felt the bar slam into her shoulder blade, which made her right arm go pins-and-needles numb. She threw a throat punch at him with it, and even though she couldn't feel it, her arm did what she told it to. Crowbar dropped his weapon and clutched his throat with both hands, gagging.

    I've always tried to avoid infodumps; when I can't see any way to avoid them, I try to make them less boring by inserting them into a more dramatic context. So a first draft conversation around a conference table ends up taking place during an invasive and painful decontamination procedure in the final version. Someone who starts off pondering the biochemistry of a certain microbe while sitting in a chair might, by the time the book makes it into print, find herself being forced to work through the same questions under torture. Anything to avoid endless pages of talking heads spouting facts at each other.
