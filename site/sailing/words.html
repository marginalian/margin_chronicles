      <h2>Bight</h2>
      <p>[noun]</p><ul>
      <li>a curve or recess in a coastline, river, or other geographical feature.</li>
      <li>a loop of rope, as distinct from the rope's ends.</li></ul>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">While I was steering I got caught by a large wave which swept me and a sail bag on to the lee deck, filled the cockpit, and snapped the boat hook in two. Margaret and I have both been wearing safety harnesses plus an additional <span class='highlight'>bight</span> of line tied around us and made fast to a cleat. After a second wave put me across the lee deck I hove the yacht to.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Two on a Big Ocean - Hal Roth</div>

      <h2>Bitts</h2>
      <p>[noun] a pair of posts on the deck of a ship for fastening mooring lines or cables.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Larry had warned me of possible dangers of towing a heavy-displacement boat like Seraffyn at over seven knots (theoretical hull speed plus one-quarter). It could impose strains that could jerk our <span class='highlight'>bitts</span> loose, besides causing Seraffyn to be difficult to steer.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Seraffyn's European Adventure - Lin Pardey</div>
</div>
</p>
      <h2>Boltrope</h2>
      <p>[noun] a strong rope stitched to the edges of a sail to strengthen it.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Each seam was triple-stitched, and three rows of reefpoints were sewn in place, with the clew and tack patches strongly reinforced. Then Larry set to work using his new skills to handsew the <span class='highlight'>boltrope</span>. He handstitched every ring into the sail. The results were great. In four years not one ring or seam has needed repairs. We’ve also been able to hoist, lower, or reef the sail on any point of the wind, no battens or headboard to catch under the spreaders, shrouds, or lazy jacks.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Seraffyn's European Adventure - Lin Pardey</div>
</div>
</p>
      <h2>Broach</h2>
      <p>[noun/verb] a sudden and hazardous veering or pitching of a ship.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">[T]hen we “<span class='highlight'>broach</span>ed to,” which was a little too exciting. When a boat which is running <span class='highlight'>broach</span>es, it appears suddenly to change its mind about the direction in which it is sailing and to attempt to change its course, swinging abruptly around and abeam to the wind. This action, in proper concert with a passing wave, can cause the occupants of a dinghy to become swimmers. We were wearing buoyancy aids, but these did not make the prospect seem any more inviting. We <span class='highlight'>broach</span>ed twice before I learned to anticipate the movement and keep us on a straight course.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blue Water, Green Skipper - Stuart Woods</div>

</p>
      <h2>Catenary</h2>
      <p>[noun] a curve formed by a wire, rope, or chain hanging freely from two points and forming a U shape</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">You will no doubt have noticed that we carry quite a lot of chain on Badger. Originally, we decided to keep weight out of the bows and just anchor on a 15-kilo Bruce, 40 feet of chain and then warp. However, we soon got fed up of Badger walking all over the place at anchor and went back to using mainly chain. Apart from the <span class='highlight'>catenary</span> effect which is due to its weight, another advantage of chain over rope is that it is unlikely to chafe through on rock or coral, thus removing one of the worries of anchoring in that type of bottom.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Voyaging on a Small Income - Annie Hill</div>

</p>
      <h2>Crosstrees</h2>
      <p>[noun] a pair of horizontal struts attached to a sailing ship's mast to spread the rigging, especially at the head of a topmast.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Finally, late Monday afternoon, I made one last assault on the mast. I ran the boat off to steady her as much as possible, got into a harness, and started laboriously up the stick, clipping one of the two stainless-steel carbine hooks onto a higher step before unclipping the lower one. That way if I slipped I would always be hooked onto something, although I didn’t relish the thought of swinging around like a pendulum from a rope clipped to a mast step. I stopped at the <span class='highlight'>crosstrees</span> to rest my hands, which were already very tired from gripping the steps so tightly, then continued.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blue Water, Green Skipper - Stuart Woods</div>

</p>
      <h2>Cutwater</h2>
      <p>[noun] the forward edge of a ship's prow.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">The bobstay runs from <span class='highlight'>cutwater</span> to bowsprit, pulling the bowsprit down against the upward tension of the forestay and head-stay. When it failed, the bowsprit rose a foot, and all fore-and-aft support of the masts was lost.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blown Away - Herb Payson</div>
</div>
</p>
      <h2>Dolphin Striker</h2>
      <p>aka Martingale Boom, Martingale, striker.</p>
      <p>[noun] a vertical spar under the end of the bowsprit of a sailboat to extend and support the martingale.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">The <span class='highlight'>dolphin striker</span> was sticking out at a crazy angle. The jumper stay to the tip of the bowsprit was hanging in the water. A swaged stainless-steel fitting had just cracked apart.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blown Away - Herb Payson</div>
</div>
</p>
      <h2>Ensign</h2>
      <p>[noun] a flag flown to indicate nationality.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">As we short-tacked past the old verandaed buildings of the Royal Dart Yacht Club, Larry asked me to set our Canadian <span class='highlight'>ensign</span>. I climbed aft of the boom gallows and reached up to hook the flag onto its grommet on the backstay. Larry called a regulation “Ready about,” then brought Seraffyn up into the wind. I snapped the lower hook of the flag in place and moved clear of the boom as Seraffyn paid off on the other tack.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Seraffyn's European Adventure - Lin Pardey</div>
</div>
</p>
      <h2>Freeboard</h2>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">The <span class='highlight'>freeboard</span> is the amount of hull between the deck and the waterline, and, so my reading had told me, was a principal factor in seaworthiness.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blue Water, Green Skipper - Stuart Woods</div>
</div>
</p>
      <h2>Overfall</h2>
      <p>[noun] a turbulent stretch of open water caused by the wind blowing against a current, by a strong current or tide over an underwater ridge, or by a meeting of currents.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Then we both heard it at the same time, pushing up behind us. Something sounded like a cross between an airplane, a vacuum cleaner, and a waterfall. Seconds after we first heard the roar, a huge hovercraft burst through the fog, radar scanner scanning, water foaming at its base. It was past us in seconds and disappeared through the fog at the mouth of the harbor. We followed it at our infinitely slower pace, bucking and weaving through the <span class='highlight'>overfalls</span>.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Seraffyn's European Adventure - Lin Pardey</div>
</div>
</p>
      <h2>Jubilee Clip</h2>
      <p>[noun]  a genericized brand name for worm-drive hose clamp, a type of band clamp, consisting of circular metal band or strip combined with a worm gear fixed to one end. It is designed to hold a soft, pliable hose onto a rigid circular pipe, or sometimes a solid spigot, of smaller diameter.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">I jumped down the companionway ladder to find a heavy stream of water entering the cabin from the engine bay. I got the ladder and engine bulkhead off and found a bare-ended hose pouring water into the boat at the rate of about twenty gallons a minute. Fortunately, a wine cork was the perfect size to plug the hose, and with a <span class='highlight'>jubilee clip</span> tightened around the whole thing, it seemed watertight. But we canceled the cruise to Kinsale and settled for a sail around Cork Harbor, uncertain what other defects we might find.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blue Water, Green Skipper - Stuart Woods</div>

      <h2>Plimsoll Line</h2>
      <p>aka "Waterline".</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Our friend looked embarrassed about coming to the point. Suddenly his wife emerged from her private, glowing world like the dormouse coming out of the teapot.</div><div class="single-blockquote">“We thought you were leaving today,” she said, working up to a tear or two. “We came all the way down to wave goodbye as you sail off into the sunset. Aren’t you going to leave?”</div><div class="single-blockquote">“Damn,” I said to the crew. “I think we’ve got to leave.”</div><div class="single-blockquote">“There’s absolutely no question about it,” said Nancy, getting to her feet.</div><div class="single-blockquote">Which is how and why Sea Foam, <span class='highlight'>plimsoll line</span> two feet under, wallowed out of San Diego Channel into the stunning Saturday afternoon sunset.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blown Away - Herb Payson</div>

      <h2>Reed's Almanac</h2>
      <p>Nautical Almanac that has been in print since 1932.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Clearance was more a matter of being welcomed by the smiling officials than paperwork. Even our still-plentiful stock of duty-free liquor caused no problem since the English rule, which we’d read in <span class='highlight'>Reed's Almanac</span>, is that any yacht owned by a member of a recognized foreign yacht club may carry as much spirits and liquor as would “be reasonably consumed on board during the intended length of stay.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Seraffyn's European Adventure - Lin Pardey</div>

      <h2>Reeve</h2>
      <p>[verb] thread (a rope or rod) through a ring or other aperture, especially in a block.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Closer to the equator we had expected the south equatorial current to give us twenty to thirty-five miles of westing per day. Instead we found that Whisper was getting set east about twenty miles a day. But it didn’t matter. We were in no hurry. We had plenty of food, good books to read, and always a few odd jobs to do—fix a cockpit locker hinge, <span class='highlight'>reeve</span> a new topping lift, or sew a pair of torn trousers.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Two on a Big Ocean - Hal Roth</div>

</p>
      <h2>Sailing by the lee</h2>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">We sailed on peacefully for a while, and then the wind began to back, and we were having to sail ten degrees above our course to keep from <span class='highlight'>sailing by the lee</span>, that is, with the wind coming from a direction where the boat might accidentally jibe.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blue Water, Green Skipper - Stuart Woods</div>

      <h2>Samson Post</h2>
      <p>[noun] a strong pillar fixed to a ship's deck to act as a support for a tackle or other equipment.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">In Huahine we rigged a huge underbelly sling, a long chain that led from the stern <span class='highlight'>samson post</span> in a great loop under the forefoot. To this we attached the bobstay with a turnbuckle, having first wrapped the giant loop of chain with carpet and rags at points of chafe.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blown Away - Herb Payson</div>

      <h2>Seagirt</h2>
      <p>[adj] surrounded by the sea[noun]</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">From other sailors I heard of the charms of those palm-lined atolls in the Chagos Group, offering wide lagoon anchorages and <span class='highlight'>seagirt</span> tranquility.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Across Islands and Oceans - James Baldwin</div>
</div>

      <h2>Skeg</h2>
      <p>[noun] a tapering or projecting stern section of a vessel's keel, which protects the propeller and supports the rudder.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">He’d add a <span class='highlight'>skeg</span>, maybe, to make the boat a bit more directionally stable off the wind and to help the self-steering, which would have to be fitted for the race. I told him I’d think about it.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blue Water, Green Skipper - Stuart Woods</div>
</div>
</p>
      <h2>Skerry</h2>
      <p>[noun] reef or rocky island.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">When the cost of miles covered has to be counted, few of us will switch on the engine to save time (“for what?” one asks). As with so many aspects of voyaging on a small income, this economy actually leads to more enjoyment and greater satisfaction. Any fool can steer a boat downwind across the ocean — the test of handling a boat is in sailing in and out of anchorages and because this is where the skill lies, this is also where the most fun is. Neither of us is that keen on steering, but when it comes to entering a harbour or sailing a tricky course among the <span class='highlight'>skerries</span>, we both enjoy it so much that we have to take it in turns to ensure fairness. Even more fun is sailing out, with the added challenge of making sure that you get away on the correct tack.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Voyaging on a Small Income - Annie Hill</div>

      <h2>Sternsheets</h2>
      <p>[noun] the flooring planks in a boat's after section, or the seating in this section of an open boat.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">When it came time to leave, his wife offered to row the short distance back to their boat. “Naw, we’ll power,” said her husband, plopping determinedly into the <span class='highlight'>sternsheets</span>.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Blown Away - Herb Payson</div>

      <h2>Stevedore</h2>
      <p>[noun] a person hired to unload cargo from a ship.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">The quayside was filled with scampering children, elders sitting and chatting, and vendors selling drinking nuts, mangoes, and ice cream from hand freezers. Above us <span class='highlight'>stevedores</span> slung thick rope nets around greasy bags of copra. The men and women wore wide-brimmed hats woven from pandanus, and when they walked you heard the soft flip-flop of their sandals.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Two on a Big Ocean - Hal Roth</div>

      <h2>Veer</h2>
      <p>[verb] slacken or let out (a rope or cable) in a controlled way.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">The fog lifted a bit and we saw a U.S. flag above the main Coast Guard building. Through the glasses I watched a man disappear. In a moment the front door opened and a dozen men ran out. They jumped into a truck and speeded toward the rickety pier we were approaching. We handed the jib, dropped an anchor, <span class='highlight'>veered</span> fathoms and fathoms of chain, and as the ship swung we passed lines to the men on the pier.</div><div class='nab-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;Two on a Big Ocean - Hal Roth</div>

  <div class="single-blockquote">The whole of the time I was at the top of the mast I thought about two things to the exclusion of everything else.
