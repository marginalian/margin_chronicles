      <h1>Lin Pardey Makes Her Case for Choosing a Small Boat</h1>
      <p>What size boat do I need to cruise full-time? How small is too small? Are larger boats safer in rough seas?

      <h1>Annie Hill on the mindset behind successful long-term cruising</h1>
      <p>Just about every sailing memoir begins with the dream. The author describes the moment they realized that they could set off on a cruising adventure. They read about those who have done it before, and they research everything they'll need to know once they cast off. And then, as often as not, they describe all the people they meet who have the same dream but who will never reach for it.</p>
