      <h1>Lin Pardey Makes Her Case for Choosing a Small Boat</h1>
      <p>What size boat do I need to cruise full-time? How small is too small? Are larger boats safer in rough seas? These are some of the boat-size questions that face the prospective blue-water cruiser, and there are no easy answers. A quick review of famous cruising vessels doesn't make matters clearer.</p>
      <p>Annie Hill cruised the world on a 36-footer with a junk rig. The Smeetons sailed for decades on a 46-foot ketch. But their one-time sailing companion, John Guzzwell, was content on a 20-foot yawl. Moitessier rounded cape horn on his 40-foot steel ketch. And Joshua Slocum, after whom Moitessier's boat was named, sailed on a 36 footer.</p>
      <p>Many long-term cruisers have written about boat size, but few have done so quite so often as the Pardeys. Their books are full of impassioned descriptions of small boats and their virtues. And, if there's anyone qualified to discuss the matter, it's the Pardeys. When they began to feel that their 24-foot cutter was a little too small, they upgraded to 29 feet and sailed that for another several decades.</p>
      <p><blockquote class='pull-quote'>Cruising represents freedom&mdash;small boats ensure freedom</blockquote></p>
      <p>In their second travelogue, <em>Seraffyn's European Adventure</em>, the Pardeys describe the trends they've seen among fellow cruisers.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">When we think of the cruising friends we’ve met in the past eight years, one fact becomes obvious. Most people who cruise away from home waters year in and year out, living on money they earn before they leave or as they cruise, have small yachts. By small we mean thirty-two feet or under. Even those with private incomes who cruise year in and year out usually choose boats around thirty-five feet on deck. Cruising Represents Freedom—Small Boats Ensure Freedom.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>That forms the crux of their argument: you are more likely to cruise and to continue to cruise if you choose a smaller boat. But, in thier view, the choice between larger and smaller boats is not just a financial decision. The true consideration is freedom.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Since we have no private income, we equate money with time off. The difference between the outfitted forty-five footer and the outfitted thirty- footer means starting to cruise years sooner, or having money for extra years of cruising. We are willing to give up a lot of physical luxuries for all those years of freedom.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>Time saved up front means more time to cruise. But the time-savings aren't confined to the refitting process.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Everything costs more for the larger boat. Mooring fees are charged by the foot. Cruising permits (an unhappily expanding custom) cost according to size. Hauling, gear, and equipment costs depend on boat size. And finally, human nature being what it is, tradesmen and suppliers identify with the man on a small boat. But they see a forty-five-footer and assume the owner must be rich, so they charge accordingly.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>This idea of giving up luxuries to gain independence is a core belief held by many long time cruisers. But money saved is not the only motivator for choosing a smaller boat. Larger boats come with another set of challenges:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Since engines are not infallible, long-term-cruising people are occasionally going to be forced to short-tack into some strange harbor under sail alone. On a thirty-footer it’s a pleasant challenge; on a forty-five- footer it’s plain hard work.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <blockquote>[...]</blockquote>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Often people in forty-five-footers seem to have lost the joy of sailing. Yes, they still make passages mostly under sail, but they rarely seem to go “out for a day sail.” Once again, this is caused by the problem of handling the big boat. It’s too much work to lift a forty-five-footer’s anchor and set its sails just for a cruise around the harbor.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>These points make sense, though they only address boat life near land. What about safety? Especially in the open ocean. The Pardeys tackle this question head-on:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">When it comes to storm conditions, no boat is really comfortable no matter what its size, but the man on the thirty-footer might have one advantage. Because his gear will be smaller and easier to manhandle, be it storm trysail, sea anchor, warps, he might be ready to take preventative measures sooner. Because of his boat’s smaller size and generally shallower draft, the man on the thirty-footer would probably find more places of refuge available to him than the man on the forty-five-footer. Yes, the small-boat sailor will have to think twice before choosing to round the Horn or take a winter passage. He may choose to lay in port and wait out a gale the man in a forty-five-footer may challenge. But prudence and good seamanship, not the boat’s size, are where safety lies.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>Here, they are speaking from a wealth of experience on small boats. Together, they sailed more than 200,000 nautical miles on boats under 30 feet.</p>
      <p>But what about all those luxuries that could make life on the water a little easier? The Pardeys caution that those comforts aren't always what you bargain for:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Yes, I’d sometimes like the physical luxuries of a forty-five-foot yacht— an enclosed shower, a powered anchor winch, hot water, refrigeration. But from delivering big yachts we’ve learned that each of these items not only requires constant maintenance but seems to break down just when you want it. When you are tied up in a marina for four months trying to get repairs done, waiting out winter gales, or working to earn money for your cruise, even a forty-five-footer is a poor excuse for an apartment.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <blockquote>[...]</blockquote>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">It all comes down to deciding what comfort is. To us, it means being free to go. The reason we can afford to go is because of Seraffyn’s small size.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>Here is the real power behind the Pardey point of view. It's not necessarily an either/or choice between comfort and thrift. You can have both if you redefine what comfort means to you.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">Since we can afford the best equipment and can be sure Seraffyn is well maintained from masthead to keel, we have the mental “comfort” of confidence. We know we can push Seraffyn to her sailing limit if it becomes necessary. And we are “comforted” by the knowledge that either one of us can handle her in almost any situation.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>This challenge to the concept of comfort is echoed and intensified two decades later by Annie Hill who argued that <a target='' href='../pages/1579277052.html'>simplicity is another form of comfort</a>.</p>
      <p><em>Seraffyn's European Adventure</em> is full of great advice to the novice cruiser and it's well worth reading cover-to-cover.</p>
