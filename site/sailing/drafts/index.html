      <h2>Books that Keep the Dream Alive</h2>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Turning your life around—changing it completely—is a thought which is attractive to many, but which most people reject as too risky. For some, the armchair is enough.

      <h2>The Lure of the Ocean</h2>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>For the first time it occurred to me this afternoon what a piece of wonder a river is&mdash;a huge volume of matter ceaselessly rolling through the fields and meadows of this substantial earth, making haste from the high places, by stable dwellings of men and Egyptian Pyramids, to its restless reservoir. One would think that, by a very natural impulse, the dwellers upon the headwaters of the Mississippi and Amazon would follow in the trail of their waters to see the end of the matter.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&mdash;&nbsp;The Journal of Henry David Thoreau, 1837-1861 - Henry David Thoreau</div>
