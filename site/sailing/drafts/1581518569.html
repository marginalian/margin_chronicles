      <p id=''><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>For the first time it occurred to me this afternoon what a piece of wonder a river is&mdash;a huge volume of matter ceaselessly rolling through the fields and meadows of this substantial earth, making haste from the high places, by stable dwellings of men and Egyptian Pyramids, to its restless reservoir. One would think that, by a very natural impulse, the dwellers upon the headwaters of the Mississippi and Amazon would follow in the trail of their waters to see the end of the matter.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;The Journal of Henry David Thoreau, 1837-1861 - Henry David Thoreau</div>

      <p id=''>If you ask a 5 sailors how to approach a boat project, you'll likely hear 5 different solutions, each presented as the best way. You're also likely to hear from each of them why the other 4 solutions are idiotic, over-engineered, under-engineered or just plain wrong.</p>
      <p id=''>Sailors can find many things to passionately disagree about. Whether it's <a target='' href='../pages/1581654976.html'>boat size</a>, technologies, budget. But once you cut through the superficial disagreements, there is a strong sense of shared experience and commraderie among sailors. Afterall, they share a <a target='' href='./1586119210.html'>heritage</a> that can form common ground between disparate backgrounds, lifestyles and experience levels.</p>
      <p id=''>Reading through sailing travelogues casts this point in sharp relief. Cruisers of wildly different backgrounds and generations write of their experiences in strikingly similar language. Boats, sensibilities and cultural mores change often, but the ocean remains largely unchanged.</p>
      <p id=''>Inevitably, long-term cruisers will return to land for short periods, whether to work on repairs, spend time with family or replinish an empty kitty. During that time, spent away from their floating homes, they often write of a natural, physical urge to return to the sea.</p>
      <p id=''>Often they describe it as all-consuming&mdash;irresistible:</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>I felt such a need to rediscover the wind of the high sea, nothing else counted at that moment, neither earth nor men. All Joshua and I wanted was to be left alone with ourselves. Any other thing did not exist, had never existed. You do not ask a tame seagull why it needs to disappear from time to time toward the open sea. It goes, that's all, and it is as simple as a ray of sunshine, as normal as the blue of the sky.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;The Long Way - Bernard Moitessier</div>

      <p id=''>Some describe it as a mixture of positive and negative feelings. Despite the comforts of land, they feel the pull and know it won't be long until they are back in the elements:</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>Is it in the nature of all of us, or is it just my own peculiar make-up which brings, when the wind blows, that queer feeling, mingled longing and dread? A thousand invisible fingers seem to be pulling me, trying to draw me away from the four walls where I have every comfort, into the open where I shall have to use my wits and my strength to fool the sea in its treacherous moods, to take advantage of fair winds and to fight when I am fairly caught—for a man is a fool to think he can conquer nature.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>It had been a long time since I had felt the weather-glow on my face, a feeling akin to the numb forehead in the first touch of inebriety.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Alone in the Caribbean - Frederic A.

      <p id=''>A life of travel is vivid in ways that are hard to replicate in a familiar, stationary life. Grappling with both nature and new cultures is exhilerating. It's not hard to imagine that their thoughts soon turn back toward travel:</p>
      <blockquote id=''>[1979]</blockquote>
      <p id=''><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>We began to notice a strange fact. Our pleasure in the beautiful three-bedroom stone-floored house with its often-used grand piano seemed to diminish as our freedom fund increased. At first we loved having so much room to spread out, and often dined in front of the living room fire when the dining room table was covered with Seraffyn’s freshly varnished hatches, blocks, and bunk boards. But I began to tire of forever leaving the one thing I needed for my downstairs projects in one of the upstairs rooms. I began to resent having to vacuum and dust five rooms when we only used two most of the time. The delight of knowing exactly where to buy each thing I needed in the local shops soon turned to boredom when I never saw a vegetable that was new to me and never found a sausage I hadn’t tried before. The novelty of being able to go to a movie any time we wanted, or listen to live folk music at the local club, or hear a symphony orchestra soon lost their glamor when we always had to drive through the same streets to reach them. It took four and a half months of work before our cruising fund reached the minimum figure we’ d set—three thousand dollars. The minute it was fifty dollars over, Larry finished up his last contract and quit working, and we knew it was time to migrate.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Seraffyn's European Adventure - Lin Pardey</div>

      <p id=''>Other sailors, when confronted with these feelings, find it easiest to blame them on the boat:</p>
