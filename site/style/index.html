      <p id='' ><em>A collection of writing lessons learned while reading speculative fiction. They usually begin with the same question: why was that sentence/passage/plot so successful?</em></p><ul>

      <h2 id='micro' >Micro</h2>
      <p id='' >Notes on sentence and inter-sentence style. Finishing touches, like similes and word choice, happen at the micro level.</p>
      <h3 id='dialogue' >Dialogue</h3><ul>
      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1577983858.html'>The Care and Handling of Throwaway Characters</a> - If you would like to add pizzazz to a dialogue tag, don't change those speech act verbs. Instead, consider changing the pronoun.</li></ul>

      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1580790115.html'>The Le Guin Binary. The Nivenette</a> - Be creative; be concise.</li></ul>
      <h3 id='similes&#95;&&#95;metaphors' >Similes & Metaphors</h3>
      <p id='' >A metaphor is an opportunity to draw the reader's attention to something. Use them to pick out a detail that may be useful later.</p><ul>
      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1587951537.html'>The Triple-Down Metaphor</a> - Use extended metaphors to hammer home a point.</li>
      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1607654585.html'>Weavers Think About Weaving</a> - Keep your similes consistent with the story's point of view.</li></ul>
      <h2 id='meso' >Meso</h2>
      <p id='' >Notes on how different sections of the story support each other. This section also examines the transitions between sections (analepses, prolepses, scene breaks, et al).</p>
      <h3 id='beginnings' >Beginnings</h3><ul>
      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1588686483.html'>You Only Get 3 Paragraphs</a> - Take your opening sentences seriously&mdash;do more than just set the scene.</li></ul>

      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1584284992.html'>Character v Character: Tension, Done Well</a> - Use character differences to build tension quickly.</li></ul>
      <h3 id='setting' >Setting</h3>
      <p id='' >No story can survive on dialogue and action alone. The reader needs to have a world in their mind's eye, before a writer can start to fill that world with witty starship captains and enigmatic aliens. Conventionally, short stories and early novel chapters begin with descriptions of the setting.</p><ul>
      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1578083491.html'>Pairing Description with Action</a> - Break up long passages of setting description by interweaving it with action.</li></ul>
      <h3 id='exposing&#95;exposition' >Exposing Exposition</h3>
      <p id='' >A speculative story's plot is often driven by a novel idea: future technologies, strange natural events, etc. The writer must make extra efforts to describe these ideas clearly without boring the reader.</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'><em>Exposition</em> is the explanation of events or circumstances not given narrative or dramatic treatment in the story. Sometimes referred to as the "expository lump"&mdash;because, I suppose, it is so hard for the reader to swallow if presented clumsily.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Paragons - Robin Wilson</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >Sometimes, the best way to add a block of description to a scene is to interrupt the main narrative with a flashback (or flashforward). Flashbacks are a familiar device. Hiding the exposition within one is often more palatable to readers than an unclear interruption of indeterminable length.</p><ul>
      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1582067416.html'>What Came Before</a> - Use external analepses to build context around the main narrative.</li>
      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1604374609.html'>A Trio of Analepses</a> - Be inventive with the structure of flash backs.</li>
      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1580270620.html'>Future Exposition, Now</a> - Flash forwards must have clear beginnings and ends. A smooth transition may take several sentences.</li></ul>
      <p id='' >Sometimes it's impossible to avoid adding a giant block of exposition into the narrative. In these cases, look for ways to keep the passage interesting. <div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>I've always tried to avoid infodumps; when I can't see any way to avoid them, I try to make them less boring by inserting them into a more dramatic context. So a first draft conversation around a conference table ends up taking place during an invasive and painful decontamination procedure in the final version. Someone who starts off pondering the biochemistry of a certain microbe while sitting in a chair might, by the time the book makes it into print, find herself being forced to work through the same questions under torture. Anything to avoid endless pages of talking heads spouting facts at each other.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Starfish and Sunflowers: A Conversation with Peter Watts - Peter Watts (interviewer: Arley Sorg)</div>

      <h2 id='macro' >Macro</h2>
      <p id='' >There are patterns that apply to each part of a story or to the story itself as a unit.</p>

      <li id='' ><a target='' href='./pages/1610073927.html'>Hinting at Reversals</a> - deepen the tragedy or satisfaction of a reversal by building a bright future ahead of the protagonist that she will never reach.</li></ul><br /><hr>
