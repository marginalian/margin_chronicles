  <div class='single-blockquote'>I splurged and booked us the double bed. It was technically a honey-moon suite, but no one asked questions. The room was a deep shade of coral read. I sighed with relief when I saw it; Casto had developed a new fear of the color green. The New Expressway staff waited to close the bed’s rounded canopy until after Casto fell asleep. I stayed awake until her hand went slack in mine and a snore escaped her lips. I watched at the attendants in their goldenrod uniforms eased the dome shut. My eyelids closed with it.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Waking up from the sedation comes easy, except for the cold. The sleep feels momentary and infinite. Two seconds or two eons ago, it was summer on Dardanus. Now it’s winter on Mars. It was the year of our seveny-eighth birthday. Now, we’re seventy-nine, four hundred years later.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>The goldenrods who have spent the last four hundred days caring for us escort us through the concourse to out cab.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Our Fate, Told in Photons - K.W.

Not, however, Vermeer.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>I told her about the lock, but only until I could see her interest drift away. It didn’t take long. We talked then about the house: who might buy it, what they might pay, what needed to be done before it went on the market, and who needed to be hired to do it. Layla didn’t talk long but she did talk, and when she ended the call, I poured away the rest of my Scotch. I didn’t need it. Layla was functional, at least for the moment, and I could concentrate on tomorrow in the lab.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Little Animals - Nancy Kress</div>
