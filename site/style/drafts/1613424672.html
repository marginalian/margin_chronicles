      <h1 id='defining&#95;the&#95;term' >Defining the Term</h1><br />
      <p id='' >This is a structure that takes a new (to the reader) word and elucidates it slowly. Can this form the structure of an entire story? It can and does for the Nebula award winning short story "Aye, and Gomorrah" by Samuel R. Delany.</p><hr>
      <p id='' ><em>A quick note on story length: my copy of "Aye, and Gomorrah" is 13 pages long, which I tell you to contextualize any reference to page numbers (e.g. by page 2...).</em></p><hr>
      <p id='' > First, this structure is partly responsible for generating the plot, which could be synopsized as: in a future where society neuters astronauts at birth to avoid the harmful effects of radiation, one such "spacer" astronaut returns to Earth and shares an encounter with a woman who fetishizes the androgynous effects of the spacer's neutering. Some details: this fetishization is widespread enough that it forms a subculture of people who pay spacers for sexual acts. Both the spacers (and the world at large) deride this behavior as bizare and disgusting.</p>
      <p id='' >The synopsis is interesting, to be sure, but what keeps the reader's attention is the defining and redefining of the word <em>frelk</em> which is a derogatory term for a person who fetishizes spacers.</p>
      <h2 id='connotations&#95;only' >Connotations Only</h2>
      <p id='' >Stories using this structure often begin by dropping the term early in the story without any explanation, immediately piquing the reader's curiosity. Delany first uses the word in the fifth paragraph of the story:</p>
      <blockquote id='' >I looked at his hand on my blue uniform. "<em>Est-ce que tu un frelk?</em>"</blockquote>
      <blockquote id='' >His eyebrows rose, then he shook his head. "Une <em>frelk</em>," he corrected. "No I am not. Sadly for me. You look as though you may once have been a man. But now..." He smiled. "You have nothing for me now."</blockquote>
      <p id='' >Here's our first encounter with the word. The fact that it first occurs in a foreign language increases its strangeness. The reader's first understanding is that it has something to do with sex.</p>
      <p id='' >Now, who wouldn't be interested in learning what the word means? It forms the dramatic question that propells the reader through the first handful of pages: what exactly is a frelk?</p>
      <p id='' >For two pages, the spacer travels with friends all over the world, landing in new places and asking people if they are frelks. None are to be found, but the reader learns more of the word's connotations. Then, on page three, one of the spacer's friends says:</p>
      <blockquote id='' >"They held up my check at the purser's office," Kelly explained. "I'm flat broke. I think the purser's got it in for me," and shrugged. "Don't want to, but I'm going to have to hunt up a rich frelk and come on friendly, went back to the tea; <em>then</em> noticed how heavy the silence had become. "Aw, come <em>on</em>, now! You gape at me like that and I'll bust every bone in that carefully-conditioned-from-puberty body of yours. Hey you!" meaning me. "Don't give me that holier-than-thou gawk like you never went with no frelk!"</blockquote>
      <p id='' >The idea we're building in our heads of the word frelk changes: it involves money, giving money to spacers.</p>
      <p id='' >Page four continues the chat between the group of spacers. They tell a few anecdotes about frelks that don't lend much more clarity to the term. By now, we're a third of the way through the story and it's time for a change; the reader is enjoying these small glimpses at the meaning behind the word, but the mystery can't last forever. You (the writer) would risk overreaching and losing the reader's attention or overpromising and causing dissapointment. So what's next?</p>
      <p id='' >The group of spacers go their separate ways in Istanbul, looking for frelks in earnest. The main character meets a stranger (a young woman). The reader wonders: <em>is this a frelk? She must be a frelk.</em></p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>The writerly fulfilling of readerly expectations&mdash;especially at the structural level&mdash;is pleasurable to the reader. (From one point of view, a novel is nothing <em>but</em> a concatenation of structural readerly expectations. The writer’s task is to fulfill those expectations at the structural level in such a way that nevertheless lets the text generate an unexpected plot or story.)</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Some Notes for the Intermediate and Advanced Creative Writing Student - Samuel R.

</p>
      <p id='' >Shortly, she drops the pretense. We see a frelk at last.</p>
      <h2 id='revealing&#95;the&#95;denotation' >Revealing the Denotation</h2>
      <p id='' >They begin to chat. Our protagonist asks her if she'll pay him. She declines (too poor). They get to talking and she expresses regret that spacers have to be neutered, that there has to be some other way. The protagonist responds:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>“It was a fine solution.” I grinned and put my hand over my crotch. “I’m happy with it.” And scratched. I’ve never known why that’s so much more obscene when a spacer does it.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Stop it,” she snapped, moving away.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“What’s the matter?”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Stop it,” She repeated. “Don’t do that! You’re a child.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“But they chose us from the children whose sexual responses are hopelessly retarded at puberty.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“And your childish, violent substitutes for love? I suppose that’s one of the things that’s attractive. Yes, I know you’re a child.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Yeah? What about frelks?”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>She thought awhile. “I think they are the sexually retarded ones they miss. Perhaps it was the right solution. You really don’t regret you have no sex?”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“We’ve got you,” I said.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Yes.” She looked down. I glanced to see the expression she was hiding. It was a smile. “You have your glorious, soaring life &mdash; and you have us.” Her face came up. She glowed. “You spin in the sky, the world spins under you, and you step from land to land, while we...” She turned her head right, left, and her black hair curled and uncurled on the shoulder of her coat. “We have our dull circled lives, bound in gravity, <em>worshipping</em> you!”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>She looked back at me. “Perverted, yes? In love with a bunch of corpses in free fall!” She suddenly hunched her shoulders. “I don’t like having a free-fall-sexual-displacement complex.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>That always sounded like too much to say.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>She looked away. “I don’t like being a frelk. Better?”</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >Not long after, she makes defines it more explicitly:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>“I want you because you can’t want me. That’s the pleasure. If someone really had a sexual reaction to... us, we’d be scared away.”</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >So, now the reader knows what a frelk is. That means the structure is concluded, right? Not so. The defining of the term spawned another question: <em>but what, exactly, do they pay for?</em></p>
      <p id='' >Naturally, the scene on page 10 (about two thirds through the story) ends with them going back to her place intending to answer this question. The reader reads on eagerly.</p>
      <h2 id='exploring&#95;implications' >Exploring Implications</h2>
      <p id='' >The scene ends in dissapointment for the protagonist, for the reader. Neither get to "see how far it goes." After finishing the story, the reader realizes how appropriate it is to feel frustrated that nothing really happenned between them, because, of course, that's exactly how a frelk would feel after trying to do anything sexual with a sexless person.</p>
      <p id='' >After reading this far, it may seem that "Aye, and Gommorah" uses this structure in a simple, straightforward way. If so, that is only because I isolated the structure to speak of it directly and glossed over the fact that Delany is definining two terms in the story: frelk and spacer. Spacer feels familiar at first when the reader see it attached to astronaut, but as the story progresses, Delany reveals details that redefine the term. The exploration of both words plays off one another, each embodied within one of the two main characters.</p>    </article>
