      <h1 id='what’s&#95;that&#95;word?' >What’s That Word?</h1><br />
      <p id='' >This is a structure that takes a new (to the reader) word and elucidates it slowly. Can this form the structure of an entire story? It can and does for the Nebula award winning short story “Aye, and Gomorrah” by Samuel R. Delany.</p>
      <p id='' >First, this structure is partly responsible for generating the plot, which could be synopsized as: in a future where society neuters astronauts at birth to avoid the harmful effects of radiation, one such “spacer” astronaut returns to Earth and shares an encounter with a woman who fetishizes the androgynous effects of the spacer’s neutering. Some details: this fetishization is widespread enough that it forms a subculture of people who pay spacers for sexual acts. Both the spacers (and the world at large) deride this behavior as bizare and disgusting.</p>
      <p id='' >The synopsis is interesting, to be sure, but what keeps the reader’s attention is the defining and redefining of the word <em>frelk</em> which is a derogatory term for a person who fetishizes spacers. “Aye, and Gomorrah” is on the shorter side (my copy is 13 pages), and this term-defining structure expands the full length. The structure is composed of three parts, roughly equal in length.</p>
      <h2 id='1.&#95;connotations&#95;only' >1. Connotations Only</h2>
      <p id='' >Stories using this structure often begin by dropping the term early in the story without any explanation, immediately piquing the reader’s curiosity. Delany first uses the word in the fifth paragraph of the story:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>“They held up my check at the purser’s office,” Kelly explained. “I’m flat broke. I think the purser’s got it in for me,” and shrugged. “Don’t want to, but I’m going to have to hunt up a rich frelk and come on friendly, went back to the tea; <em>then</em> noticed how heavy the silence had become. “Aw, come <em>on</em>, now! You gape at me like that and I’ll bust every bone in that carefully-conditioned-from-puberty body of yours. Hey you!” meaning me. “Don’t give me that holier-than-thou gawk like you never went with no frelk!”</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >Here’s our first encounter with the word. The fact that it first occurs in a foreign language increases its strangeness. The reader’s first understanding is that it has something to do with sex.</p>
      <p id='' >Now, who wouldn’t be interested in learning what the word means? It forms the dramatic question that propells the reader through the first handful of pages: what exactly is a frelk?</p>
      <p id='' >For two pages, the spacer travels with friends all over the world, landing in new places and asking people if they are frelks. None are to be found, but the reader learns more of the word’s connotations. Then, on page three, one of the spacer’s friends says:</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>“They held up my check at the purser’s office,” Kelly explained. “I’m flat broke.

</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >The idea we’re building in our heads of the word frelk changes: it involves money, giving money to spacers.</p>
      <p id='' >Page four continues the chat between the group of spacers. They tell a few anecdotes about frelks that don’t lend much more clarity to the term. By now, we’re a third of the way through the story and it’s time for a change; the reader is enjoying these small glimpses at the meaning behind the word, but the mystery can’t last forever. You (the writer) would risk overreaching and losing the reader’s attention or overpromising and causing dissapointment. So what’s next?</p>
      <p id='' >The group of spacers go their separate ways in Istanbul, looking for frelks in earnest. The main character meets a stranger (a young woman). The reader wonders: <em>is this a frelk? She must be a frelk.</em></p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>The writerly fulfilling of readerly expectations&mdash;especially at the structural level&mdash;is pleasurable to the reader. (From one point of view, a novel is nothing <em>but</em> a concatenation of structural readerly expectations. The writer’s task is to fulfill those expectations at the structural level in such a way that nevertheless lets the text generate an unexpected plot or story.)</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Some Notes for the Intermediate and Advanced Creative Writing Student - Samuel R.

</p>
      <p id='' >Shortly, she drops the pretense. We see a frelk at last.</p>
      <h2 id='2.&#95;denotation' >2. Denotation</h2>
      <p id='' >They begin to chat. Our protagonist asks her if she’ll pay him. She declines (too poor). They get to talking and she expresses regret that spacers have to be neutered, that there has to be some other way. The protagonist responds:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>“It was a fine solution.” I grinned and put my hand over my crotch. “I’m happy with it.” And scratched. I’ve never known why that’s so much more obscene when a spacer does it.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Stop it,” she snapped, moving away.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“What’s the matter?”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Stop it,” She repeated. “Don’t do that! You’re a child.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“But they chose us from the children whose sexual responses are hopelessly retarded at puberty.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“And your childish, violent substitutes for love? I suppose that’s one of the things that’s attractive. Yes, I know you’re a child.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Yeah? What about frelks?”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>She thought awhile. “I think they are the sexually retarded ones they miss. Perhaps it was the right solution. You really don’t regret you have no sex?”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“We’ve got you,” I said.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Yes.” She looked down. I glanced to see the expression she was hiding. It was a smile. “You have your glorious, soaring life &mdash; and you have us.” Her face came up. She glowed. “You spin in the sky, the world spins under you, and you step from land to land, while we...” She turned her head right, left, and her black hair curled and uncurled on the shoulder of her coat. “We have our dull circled lives, bound in gravity, <em>worshipping</em> you!”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>She looked back at me. “Perverted, yes? In love with a bunch of corpses in free fall!” She suddenly hunched her shoulders. “I don’t like having a free-fall-sexual-displacement complex.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>That always sounded like too much to say.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>She looked away. “I don’t like being a frelk. Better?”</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >Not long after, she makes defines it more explicitly:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>“I want you because you can’t want me. That’s the pleasure. If someone really had a sexual reaction to... us, we’d be scared away.”</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >So, now the reader knows what a frelk is. That means the structure is concluded, right? Not so. The defining of the term spawned another question: <em>but what, exactly, do they pay for?</em></p>
      <p id='' >Naturally, the scene on page 10 (about two thirds through the story) ends with them going back to her place intending to answer this question. The reader reads on eagerly.</p>
      <h2 id='3.&#95;exploring&#95;implications' >3. Exploring Implications</h2>
      <p id='' >In her apartment, the spacer sees that she paints moonscapes and reads space operas. They talk, drink. Then, she cuts to the chase:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>“Oh, what do you want!”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“What will you give me? I want something,” I said. “That’s why I came. I’m lonely. Maybe I want to find out how far it goes. I don’t know yet.”</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >The spacer gives voice to the reader’s expectation: we will see how far this goes. But:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>“It goes as far as you will. Me? I study, I read, paint, talk with my friends” &mdash; she cam eover to the bed, sat down on the floor &mdash; “go to the theater, look at spacers who pass me on the street, till one looks back; I am lonely too.” She put her head on my knee. “I want something. But,” and after a minute neither of us had moved, “you are not the one who will give it to me.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“You’re not going to pay me for it,” I countered. “You’re not, are you?”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>On my knee her head shook. After a while she said, all breath and no voice, “Don’t you think you... should leave?”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“Okay,” I said, and stood up.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >Delany frustrates that expectation. Without too much more talk, the spacer leaves. The scene ends in dissapointment for the protagonist, for the reader. Neither get to “see how far it goes.” This breaks the “rule” of fulfilling of readerly expectations for good reason. Isn’t exactly how a frelk must feel after attempting sex with a sexless androgyne? Unsatisfied.</p><hr>
      <p id='' >After reading this far, it may seem that “Aye, and Gommorah” uses this term-definition structure in a simple, straightforward way. If so, that is only because this essay isolated the structure to speak of it directly and glossed over the fact that Delany is definining two terms in the story: frelk and spacer. Spacer feels familiar at first when the reader sees it attached to astronaut, but as the story progresses, Delany reveals details that redefine the term. The exploration of both words plays off one another, each embodied within one of the two main characters.</p>    </article>
