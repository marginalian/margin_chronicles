  <div class='single-blockquote'>They live in Quad Four, where a lot of Nor-Ans live, Northamerican and European Ancestry people. With her usual flair for the dramatic, Jael has found an area in the outer arc where there’s room for ten-foot ceilings. “Like the sky!” she cries. She has painted the ceilings bright blue. “Feel the difference?” she says. “The sense of liberation — of freedom?” In fact, when she goes to stay with Jael on visits, Hsing finds the rooms rather disagreeable; they seem deep and cold, with all that waste space overhead. But Jael fills them with her warmth, her golden, inexhaustible voice, her bright clothing, her abundance of being.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;The Birthday of the World - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>The question strangers most often ask us is, “In those marriages of yours, do you all go to bed together?” and the answer we give is, “No.” That is in fact how we tend to answer any question from a stranger. It is amazing that we ever got into the Ekumen.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Unchosen Love - Ursula K. Le Guin</div>
