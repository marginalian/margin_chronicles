      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Tactically speaking, I’d say go ahead and crowd in the first draft—tell it all, blab, babble, put everything in. Then in revising consider what merely pads or repeats or slows or impedes your story, and cut it. Decide what counts, what tells, and cut and recombine till what’s left is what counts. Leap boldly.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Steering the Craft - Ursula  K. Le Guin</div>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>What you leap over is what you leave out. And what you leave out is infinitely more than what you leave in. There’s got to be white space around the word, silence around the voice. Listing is not describing. Only the relevant belongs. Some say God is in the details; some say the Devil is in the details. Both are correct.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Steering the Craft - Ursula  K. Le Guin</div>

      <p id='' >Captivity scene. He is a captive. His host is monologuing and doesn't want a real dialogue but requires assurance. Le Guin highlights this by not writing out the captive's responses. This works for another reason too: the audience knows how the captive feels about what's being said. We know that the host conjuring up a world that is parallel to the one that the captive has experienced. This makes the monologue monstrous.</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>She tried to meet some of the hidden owner women through the owner men, and met a wall of politeness without a door, without a peephole. What a wonderful idea; we will certainly arrange a visit when the weather is better! I should be overwhelmed with the honor if the Envoy were to entertain Lady Mayoyo and my daughters, but my foolish, provincial girls are so unforgivably timid—I’m sure you understand. Oh, surely, surely, a tour of the inner gardens—but not at present, when the vines are not in flower! We must wait until the vines are in flower!</div><div class='single-blockquote'>There was nobody to talk to, nobody, until she met Batikam the Makil.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Forgiveness Day - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>“Sit down,” said the brown-haired general, Banarkamye—Read-bible, his name could be translated. “We have some questions to ask you.” Silent but civil assent. They asked how he had got out of the embassy, who his contacts with the Liberation had been, where he had been going, why he had tried to go, what happened during the kidnapping, who had brought him here, what they had asked him, what they had wanted from him. Having decided during the afternoon that candor would serve him best, he answered all the questions directly and briefly until the last one.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“I personally am on your side of this war,” he said, “but the Ekumen is necessarily neutral.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Old Music and the Slave Women - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>Long habit prevented Esdan from asking questions that would reveal the extent of his ignorance. Rayaye like most politicians loved his own voice, and as he talked Esdan tried to piece together a rough sketch of the current situation.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>[...]</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Esdan could only guess what had happened in the half year since. Rayaye talked of “our victories in the south” as if the Legitimate Army had been on the attack, pushing back into the Free State across the Devan River, south of the city. If so, if they had regained territory, why had the government pulled out of the city and dug in down at Bellen? Rayaye’s talk of victories might be translated to mean that the Army of the Liberation had been trying to cross the river in the south and the Legitimates had been successful in holding them off. If they were willing to call that a victory, had they finally given up the dream of reversing the revolution, retaking the whole country, and decided to cut their losses?</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“A divided nation is not an option,” Rayaye said, squashing that hope. “You understand that, I think.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Civil assent.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Rayaye poured out the last of the wine. “But peace is our goal. Our very strong and urgent goal. Our unhappy country has suffered enough.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Definite assent.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“I know you to be a man of peace, Mr. Old Music. We know the Ekumen fosters harmony among and within its member states. Peace is what we all desire with all our hearts.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Assent, plus faint indication of inquiry.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“As you know, the Government of Voe Deo has always had the power to end the insurrection. The means to end it quickly and completely.” No response but alert attention. “And I think you know that it is only our respect for the policies of the Ekumen, of which my nation is a member, that has prevented us from using that means.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Absolutely no response or acknowledgment.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Old Music and the Slave Women - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>They live in Quad Four, where a lot of Nor-Ans live, Northamerican and European Ancestry people. With her usual flair for the dramatic, Jael has found an area in the outer arc where there’s room for ten-foot ceilings. “Like the sky!” she cries. She has painted the ceilings bright blue. “Feel the difference?” she says. “The sense of liberation — of freedom?” In fact, when she goes to stay with Jael on visits, Hsing finds the rooms rather disagreeable; they seem deep and cold, with all that waste space overhead. But Jael fills them with her warmth, her golden, inexhaustible voice, her bright clothing, her abundance of being.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;The Birthday of the World - Ursula K.
