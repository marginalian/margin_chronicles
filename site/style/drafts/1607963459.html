      <h1 id='leaping&#95;over&#95;dialogue' >Leaping over Dialogue</h1>
      <p id='' ><em>How much detail should I include in a story? How can I condense a portion of dialogue to avoid breaking the rhythm of the description before and after it?</em></p><hr>
      <p id='' >In her book on writing, <em>Steering the Craft</em>, Ursula K. Le Guin introduces the idea of crowding and leaping to describe portions of a story full of rich detail and others that move at a faster pace:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Tactically speaking, I’d say go ahead and crowd in the first draft—tell it all, blab, babble, put everything in. Then in revising consider what merely pads or repeats or slows or impedes your story, and cut it. Decide what counts, what tells, and cut and recombine till what’s left is what counts. Leap boldly.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >Le Guin pays extra attention to the idea of leaping, making it clear that cutting words in the right places can benefit a story.</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>What you leap over is what you leave out. And what you leave out is infinitely more than what you leave in. There’s got to be white space around the word, silence around the voice. Listing is not describing. Only the relevant belongs. Some say God is in the details; some say the Devil is in the details. Both are correct.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p id='' >This sounds wonderful. But, like most writing advice, it isn't overly specific and leaves you wondering <em>great, but how does that look in practice?</em> Of course, where an author crowds and what they leap is a matter of personal style. In her short stories and novellas, Le Guin tends to leap over dialogue and crowd in details of place.</p>
      <p id='' >Why does she do that? She explains:</p>
      <p id='' ><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>I think I am not very good at dialogue and therefore I work on it as hard as I can. I don’t have the real ear for dialogue, which is probably just a gift from God. I would say my gift is the gift of place. I’m extremely place-conscious.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;The Last Interview: And Other Conversations - Ursula K. Le Guin</div>

      <p id='' >It sounds as though dialogue took more work to write for her and description came more easily, so it's unsurprising that her stories contain less dialogue. As you read her work, you'll notice that she has crafted many ways to alter dialogue so that it is shorter.</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>She tried to meet some of the hidden owner women through the owner men, and met a wall of politeness without a door, without a peephole. What a wonderful idea; we will certainly arrange a visit when the weather is better! I should be overwhelmed with the honor if the Envoy were to entertain Lady Mayoyo and my daughters, but my foolish, provincial girls are so unforgivably timid—I’m sure you understand. Oh, surely, surely, a tour of the inner gardens—but not at present, when the vines are not in flower! We must wait until the vines are in flower!</div><div class='single-blockquote'>There was nobody to talk to, nobody, until she met Batikam the Makil.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Forgiveness Day - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>No, I hadn’t thought much about kemmer before. What would be the use? Until we come of age we have no gender and no sexuality, our hormones don’t give us any trouble at all. And in a city Hearth we never see adults in kemmer. They kiss and go. Where’s Maba? In the kemmerhouse, love, now eat your porridge. When’s Maba coming back? Soon, love. — And in a couple of days Maba comes back, looking sleepy and shiny and refreshed and exhausted. Is it like having a bath, Maba? Yes, a bit, love, and what have you been up to while I was away?</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Coming of Age in Karhide - Ursula K. Le Guin</div>

      <p id='' >Captivity scene. He is a captive. His host is monologuing and doesn't want a real dialogue but requires assurance. Le Guin highlights this by not writing out the captive's responses. This works for another reason too: the audience knows how the captive feels about what's being said. We know that the host conjuring up a world that is parallel to the one that the captive has experienced. This makes the monologue monstrous.</p>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>“Sit down,” said the brown-haired general, Banarkamye—Read-bible, his name could be translated. “We have some questions to ask you.” Silent but civil assent. They asked how he had got out of the embassy, who his contacts with the Liberation had been, where he had been going, why he had tried to go, what happened during the kidnapping, who had brought him here, what they had asked him, what they had wanted from him. Having decided during the afternoon that candor would serve him best, he answered all the questions directly and briefly until the last one.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“I personally am on your side of this war,” he said, “but the Ekumen is necessarily neutral.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Old Music and the Slave Women - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>Long habit prevented Esdan from asking questions that would reveal the extent of his ignorance. Rayaye like most politicians loved his own voice, and as he talked Esdan tried to piece together a rough sketch of the current situation.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>[...]</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Esdan could only guess what had happened in the half year since. Rayaye talked of “our victories in the south” as if the Legitimate Army had been on the attack, pushing back into the Free State across the Devan River, south of the city. If so, if they had regained territory, why had the government pulled out of the city and dug in down at Bellen? Rayaye’s talk of victories might be translated to mean that the Army of the Liberation had been trying to cross the river in the south and the Legitimates had been successful in holding them off. If they were willing to call that a victory, had they finally given up the dream of reversing the revolution, retaking the whole country, and decided to cut their losses?</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“A divided nation is not an option,” Rayaye said, squashing that hope. “You understand that, I think.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Civil assent.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Rayaye poured out the last of the wine. “But peace is our goal. Our very strong and urgent goal. Our unhappy country has suffered enough.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Definite assent.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>“I know you to be a man of peace, Mr. Old Music. We know the Ekumen fosters harmony among and within its member states.

The means to end it quickly and completely.” No response but alert attention. “And I think you know that it is only our respect for the policies of the Ekumen, of which my nation is a member, that has prevented us from using that means.”</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Absolutely no response or acknowledgment.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Old Music and the Slave Women - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>They live in Quad Four, where a lot of Nor-Ans live, Northamerican and European Ancestry people. With her usual flair for the dramatic, Jael has found an area in the outer arc where there’s room for ten-foot ceilings. “Like the sky!” she cries. She has painted the ceilings bright blue. “Feel the difference?” she says. “The sense of liberation — of freedom?” In fact, when she goes to stay with Jael on visits, Hsing finds the rooms rather disagreeable; they seem deep and cold, with all that waste space overhead. But Jael fills them with her warmth, her golden, inexhaustible voice, her bright clothing, her abundance of being.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;The Birthday of the World - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>The complexities are so evident that I am always surprised when an offworlder sees, in the multiple relationship, only the forbidden, the illicit one. “How can you be married to three people and never have sex with one of them?” they ask. The question makes me uncomfortable; it seems to assume that sexuality is a force so dominant that it cannot be contained or shaped by any other relationship.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Unchosen Love - Ursula K.

  <div class='single-blockquote'>The question strangers most often ask us is, “In those marriages of yours, do you all go to bed together?” and the answer we give is, “No.” That is in fact how we tend to answer any question from a stranger. It is amazing that we ever got into the Ekumen.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Unchosen Love - Ursula K. Le Guin</div>
