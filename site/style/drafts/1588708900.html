  <div class='single-blockquote'>A word about the way you end that first scene. The last sentence of a scene, just before the scene break, is the power position (just as the last word in a paragraph is a power position, and the last line of a chapter, and the last paragraph of a novel). Make it count. The closing sentence of a first scene should evoke some emotion—not blatantly, but through a telling detail that means more than just itself.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Beginnings, Middles & Ends - Nancy Kress</div>

      <p id=''>So how might you use with this power position, this cymbal clash? There are a great many clever uses for it.</p>
      <p id=''><strong>Repetition in the power position</strong></p>
      <p id=''>You can accentuate the final sentence of a paragraph even further using a rhetorical device to provoke a reaction from the reader. For instance, you might choose to repeat the final word in the paragraph (aka epizeuxis): <div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>His eyes met hers for one instant, keen and strange; then he pushed back his hair impatiently, growled something by way of good-bye, and started on so abruptly that she almost crouched aside to make way for him. That’s how a chief walks, she thought wryly, as she went on. Big, wide, taking up space, stamping the earth down. And this, this is how an old woman walks, narrowly, narrowly.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Betrayals - Ursula K. Le Guin</div>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>Solly had been a space brat, a Mobile’s child, living on this ship and that, this world and that; she’d traveled five hundred light-years by the time she was ten. At twenty-five she had been through a revolution on Alterra, learned aiji on Terra and farthinking from an old hilfer on Rokanan, breezed through the Schools on Hain, and survived an assignment as Observer in murderous, dying Kheakh, skipping another half millennium at near-lightspeed in the process. She was young, but she’d been around.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Forgiveness Day - Ursula K. Le Guin</div>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>All these volunteers to the Extreme Survey crews shared one peculiarity: they were of unsound mind. What sane person, after all, would go out to collect information that would not be received for five or ten centuries? Cosmic mass interference had not yet been eliminated from the operation of the ansible, and so instantaneous communication was reliable only within a range of 120 lightyears. The explorers would be quite isolated. And of course they had no idea what they might come back to, if they came back. No normal human being who had experienced time-slippage of even a few decades between League worlds would volunteer for a round trip of centuries. The Surveyors were escapists, misfits. They were nuts.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Vaster Than Empires And More Slow - Ursula K. Le Guin</div>

  <div class='single-blockquote'>The temperature of that room in the King’s Palace of Erhenrang was 12° C where Lord Gerer stood, and 5° midway between the two big fireplaces; outside it was snowing lightly, a mild day only a few degrees below freezing. Spring had come to Winter. The fires at either end of the room roared red and gold, devouring thigh-thick logs. Magnificence, a harsh luxury, a quick splendor; fireplaces, fireworks, lightning, meteors, volcanoes; such things satisfied the people of Karhide on the world called Winter. But, except in Arctic colonies above the 35th parallel, they had never installed central heating in any building in the many centuries of their Age of Technology. Comfort was allowed to come to them rare, welcome, unsought: a gift, like joy.</div><div class='notecard-source'>&nbsp;Winter's King - Ursula K. Le Guin</div>
