“You’re not going to pay me for it,” I countered. “You’re not, are you?”

“Okay,” I said, and stood up.

    “It was a fine solution.” I grinned and put my hand over my crotch. “I’m happy with it.” And scratched. I’ve never known why that’s so much more obscene when a spacer does it.

“Stop it,” she snapped, moving away.

“What’s the matter?”

“Stop it,” She repeated. “Don’t do that! You’re a child.”

“But they chose us from the children whose sexual responses are hopelessly retarded at puberty.”

“And your childish, violent substitutes for love? I suppose that’s one of the things that’s attractive. Yes, I know you’re a child.”

“Yeah? What about frelks?”

She thought awhile. “I think they are the sexually retarded ones they miss. Perhaps it was the right solution. You really don’t regret you have no sex?”

“We’ve got you,” I said.

“Yes.” She looked down. I glanced to see the expression she was hiding. It was a smile. “You have your glorious, soaring life &mdash; and you have us.” Her face came up. She glowed. “You spin in the sky, the world spins under you, and you step from land to land, while we...” She turned her head right, left, and her black hair curled and uncurled on the shoulder of her coat. “We have our dull circled lives, bound in gravity, <em>worshipping</em> you!”

She looked back at me. “Perverted, yes? In love with a bunch of corpses in free fall!” She suddenly hunched her shoulders. “I don’t like having a free-fall-sexual-displacement complex.

That always sounded like too much to say.”

She looked away. “I don’t like being a frelk. Better?”

    The writerly fulfilling of readerly expectations&mdash;especially at the structural level&mdash;is pleasurable to the reader. (From one point of view, a novel is nothing <em>but</em> a concatenation of structural readerly expectations. The writer’s task is to fulfill those expectations at the structural level in such a way that nevertheless lets the text generate an unexpected plot or story.)

    <em>Being Gardner Dozois - Gardner Dozois</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Unusually for me—since I don’t usually work this way—I wrote “A Dream at Noonday” all in one session of about two hours, in a sort of white heat. I sat down after work, in fact, in the newspaper office where I worked in the Army, and after everyone else went off, I just sat there at my typewriter and ripped this story off. It just came rushing out, with hardly any pre-planning at all. That’s not the way I usually write. It’s only happened a few times that I’ve produced a story that way, all in one sitting, as fast as I could type. So obviously there was something boiling just under the surface in subconscious there, and the pressure reached a certain pitch and the story just forced its way out.

    Aiming for the middle between purple prose and stark writing
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Being Gardner Dozois - Gardner Dozois</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Most of my career, in fact, can be seen as an attempt to bring under control and make useful a tendency toward very purple prose. I’ve fought all through my career to find a reasonable balance between purpleness and starking things out to the point where you can’t get the sort of atmospheric effects that you can occasionally manage to pull off with purple prose. Ideally, what I’ve been shooting for, with indifferent success, is a prose which combines the best features of both, which is stark and simple and yet flexible enough to enable you to pull off somberly evocative and grandiloquent effects when they’re called for in the text. Many of my stories are experiments with trying to work out this sort of hybrid.

    It’s interesting to me that very little is written about those type of people in science fiction, even today. Even the cyberpunks writing about their mean streets and their back-room lowlifes don’t actually get into blue-collar factory industrial worker type people much.

    I suspect that, like many young writers, my early stories featured glamorized versions of myself, staggering around doing one thing or another. In other words they’re very self-centered stories. I think this is true of most young writers to one extent or another. The instinct is to first play with versions of yourself, and then later on you get interested in putting other sorts of characters into the stories.

    It wasn’t an idea that would stand a lot of exposition. It’s a sort of one-jab idea. I wanted to get in a quick jab to the belly and then get out again.

[...]

So, yeah, I tried to make this as tight as possible. I think it helps the story to be that tight. You certainly can’t dwell on it and have it hold up. It’s almost a surrealistic story, in that the science fiction element is there to make you accept it as reality just long enough so that you can get the philosophical boot in. But if you start to think about it, and analyze it, and parse it out logically, the social set-up they have here is not very likely. It’s meant to be just likely enough to get you to swallow the story, so the little time-capsule of philosophical content can go off in your gut afterwards. It wouldn’t have held up under a long treatment, it would have come apart like wet toilet-paper.

  <div class='quote'>
    It was much too hot to do any work at the typewriter. So I would find a stoop or a stone stair somewhere in the neighborhood, or the park and the table-and-benches, and I would sit there and write in my notebook tablet. This sounds romantic, but it wasn’t so much a matter of romance as a matter of necessity. It was just too hot to work in the apartment. And frankly with an apartment of that size—and it was a very small apartment—with another person, Susan, and a very active child, Christopher, jammed into it, it often was too distracting to work there, even if the temperature was all right. So this is the genesis of my slouching melancholily around the neighborhood with a notebook, like some consumptive nineteenth-century Romantic poet, and sitting on people’s doorsteps and scribbling fragments of one thing and another.

    I was staying at Trina King’s apartment, crashing there while I was consulting David about the novel, and I actually wrote one of the chapters in my notebook while sitting on the floor in the bathroom. Next to the toilet, appropriately enough, for all you hostile critics out there. From time to time, someone would come in to go to the bathroom, and I would nod politely at them. I had to work in the bathroom because there was someone sleeping in the livingroom, so that had to be dark, and the bedroom had to be dark because Trina was sleeping in there. So the only place I could work was in the bathroom, where the light could be on. This is the kind of thing that makes me smile when young writers tell me they can’t work without an office of their own and a word-processor. Yeah, I finished a chapter in the bathroom there.

    I’m very concerned with finding the exactly right last line for a story. I think last lines of stories are very important, and a bad last line for a story can diminish the value of even a good story by, say, forty percent. So I spend a lot of time trying to come up with last lines of stories. I’ve been known to spend weeks trying to come up with the right last line of a story. And here, I thought of three possible last lines for the end of the story. I couldn’t decide which one to use, so I used them all in sequence.

    At that time, and likely still, the task of seeding the galaxy fell to the lowest of the low, the worst criminals of our age. Unfortunate souls whose bodies were discarded, their brains broken apart and re-formed around quantum computer elements. What was left of the neural tissue was tied to vast arrays of qubits using chemical bonds that fuse living cells with germanium. All this while cold machines inserted their unfeeling directives directly into that violated gray matter, stealing away most volition. For all of the 27th century’s scientific triumphs, no one had ever designed machinery that could emulate human judgement—meaning that an Oelinium had to retain at its center the vestiges of a human being. To the extent that any humanity remained, it was a broken shell devoid of eyes, ears, and any other human sense, stripped away of all will by a robot overlord. A fate worse than any torture, for the inquisitions of human history had always at least allowed the final respite of death

    I begin to tremble. “Wait,” I begged. “Why the subterfuge? You Earth supermen can do whatever you want with us. You didn’t need to make me a criminal first.”

He drummed his fingers, and through my shock, I found myself studying those appendages for any sign of his true nature. But they looked completely human to me.

“In your Games, you play with lower order creatures for your own amusement,” Oren said finally. “We have our Game too, with its own rules. Whenever I can turn an ordinary citizen to violent acts, I can use him how I will. Yes, I could dispense with the first step, but where would be the challenge?”

    Singularity as horrifying experience

  <div class='quote'>
    To say that I ‘awoke’ sometime later cannot truly convey my first moments as a machine. My initial recollection is one of utter senselessness. I have no sight, no hearing, no taste, no feeling. I float disembodied, with only disconnected thoughts to let me know I live. It is like dreaming, for random images and stories parade through my spinning semi-consciousness. But unlike a dream, a tiny piece of myself surveys everything.

Then, the cold steel of the Monitor intrudes on my mind. It bends my drifting thoughts towards solid purpose, fills me with an iron-willed determination to perform my function. I ache to return to my dream-like state, but the Monitor forces me to concentrate on cold, meaningless things. I feel sudden hatred, and begin fighting this with every ounce of strength I have.

I believe I ‘awoke’ sooner than was planned. The Monitor’s integration was supposed to complete before I was allowed to retrieve any part of myself. Why this mistake occurred I don’t know, but it allowed me to fight my jailer for every neuron, every cortical column.

And fight I did. I fought the Monitor in the shattered remnants of my limbic system, I fought it in my emotional centers, I fought it through every neural pathway until I thought I’d die. To this day, I believe the gains established in this early battle gave me the freedom to do what I eventually did.

    My communication with Oren has turned into a long silence, as red trails continue to light the skies. I begin to think he has already become an imbecile, when I hear his trembling voice one last time: “Why are you doing this?”

I pause for hundreds of microseconds.

“Nature’s way is for higher order creatures to do what they will with lower order animals.”

There is a brief silence, then a high pitched scream followed by gurgling, and I suspect that his satellite has crashed. The Oren that I knew is no more.

Because they are both novelists. Real novelists. They write science fiction, I imagine, because what they have to say is best said using the tools of science fiction, and the craftsman knows his tools. And still, they are novelists, because while using the great rande of imagery available to science fiction, they say what it is they have to say through a character&mdash;not a mouthpiece, but a full realized creation. The character is primary. And what used to be the entire object of science fiction&mdash;the invention of miraculous gadgets, the relations of alternate histories, and so on&mdash;is now used subjectively, as a metaphor, as a means for exploring and explaining what goes on inside [the character].

Spring had come to Winter. The fires at either end of the room roared red and gold, devouring thigh-thick logs. Magnificence, a harsh luxury, a quick splendor; fireplaces, fireworks, lightning, meteors, volcanoes; such things satisfied the people of Karhide on the world called Winter. But, except in Arctic colonies above the 35th parallel, they had never installed central heating in any building in the many centuries of their Age of Technology. Comfort was allowed to come to them rare, welcome, unsought: a gift, like joy.

The explorers would be quite isolated. And of course they had no idea what they might come back to, if they came back. No normal human being who had experienced time-slippage of even a few decades between League worlds would volunteer for a round trip of centuries. The Surveyors were escapists, misfits.

    I limit my answers to their questions to technology. I let them assume, as most people naturally assume, particularly people from a monoculture, that our society is pretty much like theirs. When they find how it differs, the effect will be revolutionary, and I have no mandate, reason, or wish to cause such a revolution on Seggri. Their gender imbalance has produced a society in which, as far as I can tell, the men have all the privilege and the women have all the power. It’s obviously a stable arrangement. According to their histories, it’s lasted at least two millennia, and probably in some form or another much longer than that. But it could be quickly and disastrously destabilised by contact with us, by their experiencing the human norm. I don’t know if the men would cling to their privileged status or demand freedom, but surely the women would resist giving up their power, and their sexual system and affectional relationships would break down. Even if they learned to undo the genetic program that was inflicted on them, it would take several generations to restore normal gender distribution. I can’t be the whisper that starts that avalanche.

    Skodr got nowhere with the men of Awaga Castle. She had to make her inquiries very cautiously, since it would endanger Kaza if she told them he was an alien or in any way unique. They’d take it as a claim of superiority, which he’d have to defend in trials of strength and skill. I gather that the hierarchies within the castles are a rigid framework, within which a man moves up or down issuing challenges and winning or losing obligatory and optional trials. The sports and games the women watch are only the showpieces of an endless series of competitions going on inside the castles. As an untrained, grown man Kaza would be at a total disadvantage in such trials. The only way he might get out of them, she said, would be by feigning illness or idiocy. She thinks he must have done so, since he is at least alive; but that’s all she could find out

    The question strangers most often ask us is, “In those marriages of yours, do you all go to bed together?” and the answer we give is, “No.” That is in fact how we tend to answer any question from a stranger. It is amazing that we ever got into the Ekumen.

    The misty sunlight, the breeze full of salt spray, the fear of the depths, the exertion of working the boat under Suord’s capable directions, the triumph of steering it back into the canal at sunset, when the light lay red-gold on the water and vast flocks of stilts and marshbirds rose crying and circling around them — it made a great day, after all, for Hadri.

    Whatever Suord said — he could not remember later what it was — was a spark to blasting-powder. “I will not be treated this way!” he cried passionately, and Suord firing up at once demanded what he meant, and they had at it, an explosion of rage and frustration and accusation that left them staring grey-faced at each other, appalled. “Hadri,” Suord said, the name a sob; he was shivering, his whole body shaking. They came together, clinging to each other. Suord’s small, rough, strong hands held Hadri close. The taste of Suord’s skin was salt as the sea. Hadri sank, sank and was drowned.

    Summer was long, clear, beautiful. I was learning to starwatch; that is when you lie down outside on the open hills in the dry season at night, and find a certain star in the eastern sky, and watch it cross the sky till it sets. You can look away, of course, to rest your eyes, and doze, but you try to keep looking back at the star and the stars around it, until you feel the earth turning, until you become aware of how the stars and the world and the soul move together. After the certain star sets you sleep until dawn wakes you. Then as always you greet the sunrise with aware silence. I was very happy on the hills those warm great nights, those clear dawns. The first time or two Hyuru and I starwatched together, but after that we went alone, and it was better alone.

    the Heyho was a Hainish-built explorer, designed to give its people room and privacy and comfort and variety and beauty while they hung around in a solar system for years on end. But it was designed. It was all human-made — everything was human. I had much more privacy than I had ever had at home in our one-room house; yet there I had been free and here I was in a trap. I felt the pressure of people all around me, all the time. People around me, people with me, people pressing on me, pressing me to be one of them, to be one of them, one of the people.

    They live in Quad Four, where a lot of Nor-Ans live, Northamerican and European Ancestry people. With her usual flair for the dramatic, Jael has found an area in the outer arc where there’s room for ten-foot ceilings. “Like the sky!” she cries. She has painted the ceilings bright blue. “Feel the difference?” she says. “The sense of liberation — of freedom?” In fact, when she goes to stay with Jael on visits, Hsing finds the rooms rather disagreeable; they seem deep and cold, with all that waste space overhead. But Jael fills them with her warmth, her golden, inexhaustible voice, her bright clothing, her abundance of being.

    One of the American science-fiction writers I admire most is Philip K. Dick, and Philip K. Dick’s world involves immense tracts of pure insanity. It’s a world which is always in danger of falling to pieces. It is an accurate picture of what is going on in a lot of people’s heads and how the world actually does affect us—this weird, disjointed, unexpected world we’re living in now. Well now, Phil Dick reflects that by using a sane, matter-of-fact prose to describe the completely insane things that happen in his novels. It is a way of mirroring reality.

The story suite is a common enough form, particularly in science fiction, that I wish (dream on!) could be recognized as such—not labeled and dismissed as a collection, certainly not as a “fix-up,” but seen as a genuine fictional form in its own right, conceived as such not patched together, and with its own intriguing and complex aesthetic.

    Well, to preach that story is conflict, always to ask, “Where’s the conflict in your story?”—this needs some thinking about. If you say that story is about conflict, that plot must be based on conflict, you’re limiting your view of the world severely. And in a sense making a political statement: that life is conflict, so in stories conflict is all that really matters. This is simply untrue. To see life as a battle is a narrow, social-Darwinist view, and a very masculine one. Conflict, of course, is part of life, I’m not saying you should try to keep it out of your stories, just that it’s not their only lifeblood. Stories are about a lot of different things.

They get an idea, which is a commonplace idea in science fiction, one that has been worked over a thousand times, worked over with all kinds of literary variations, but because science fiction was not taught as literature they don’t know that. They take this old well-worn idea and bring it forth, declaring, “Look! Look at this wonderful idea I had!”

In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool’s joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn’t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.

  <div class='quote'>
    The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting here and going straight there and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn’t any good if he isn’t in it.

I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural,  proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.

    Two men in priestly regalia were waiting for her right outside the tent door. They stepped forward immediately, taking her by the elbows and saying, “This way, this way, Lady.” Evidently she really wouldn’t have to figure out what to do. No doubt they considered women incapable of it, but in the circumstances it was a relief. The priests hurried her along faster than she could comfortably walk in the tight-drawn skirt. They were behind the bleachers now; wasn’t the enclosure in the other direction? A car was coming straight at them, scattering the few people who were in its way. Somebody was shouting; the priests suddenly began yanking her, trying to run; one of them yelled and let go her arm, felled by a flying darkness that had hit him with a jolt—she was in the middle of a melee, unable to break the iron hold on her arm, her legs imprisoned in the skirt, and there was a noise, an enormous noise, that hit her head and bent it down, she couldn’t see or hear, blinded, struggling, shoved face first into some dark place with her face pressed into a stifling, scratchy darkness and her arms held locked behind her.

The cloth of the bag kept getting stuck on her mouth, sucked against her nostrils as she tried to breathe. It was plucked off; a man stooping over her turned her so he could untape her arms,

    Long habit prevented Esdan from asking questions that would reveal the extent of his ignorance. Rayaye like most politicians loved his own voice, and as he talked Esdan tried to piece together a rough sketch of the current situation.

[...]

Esdan could only guess what had happened in the half year since. Rayaye talked of “our victories in the south” as if the Legitimate Army had been on the attack, pushing back into the Free State across the Devan River, south of the city. If so, if they had regained territory, why had the government pulled out of the city and dug in down at Bellen? Rayaye’s talk of victories might be translated to mean that the Army of the Liberation had been trying to cross the river in the south and the Legitimates had been successful in holding them off. If they were willing to call that a victory, had they finally given up the dream of reversing the revolution, retaking the whole country, and decided to cut their losses?

“A divided nation is not an option,” Rayaye said, squashing that hope. “You understand that, I think.”

Civil assent.

Rayaye poured out the last of the wine. “But peace is our goal. Our very strong and urgent goal. Our unhappy country has suffered enough.”

Definite assent.

“I know you to be a man of peace, Mr. Old Music. We know the Ekumen fosters harmony among and within its member states. Peace is what we all desire with all our hearts.”

Assent, plus faint indication of inquiry.

“As you know, the Government of Voe Deo has always had the power to end the insurrection. The means to end it quickly and completely.” No response but alert attention. “And I think you know that it is only our respect for the policies of the Ekumen, of which my nation is a member, that has prevented us from using that means.”

Absolutely no response or acknowledgment.

    If he was a double agent, Esdan thought after he left, he was working for Liberation Command. Or he hoped so. Metoy was a man he wanted on his side. But I don’t know what my side is, he thought, as he went back to his chair by the window. The Liberation, of course, yes, but what is the Liberation? Not an ideal, the freedom of the enslaved. Not now. Never again. Since the Uprising, the Liberation is an army, a political body, a great number of people and leaders and would-be leaders, ambitions and greed clogging hopes and strength, a clumsy amateur semi-government lurching from violence to compromise, ever more complicated, never again to know the beautiful simplicity of the ideal, the pure idea of liberty. And that’s what I wanted, what I worked for, all these years. To muddle the nobly simple structure of the hierarchy of caste by infecting it with the idea of justice. And then to confuse the nobly simple structure of the ideal of human equality by trying to make it real. The monolithic lie frays out into a thousand incompatible truths, and that’s what I wanted. But I am caught in the insanity, the stupidity, the meaningless brutality of the event. They all want to use me, but I’ve outlived my usefulness, he thought; and the thought went through him like a shaft of clear light. He had kept thinking there was something he could do. There wasn’t. It was a kind of freedom.

    There’s no such thing as “the passive tense.” Passive and active aren’t tenses, they’re modes of the verb. Each mode is useful and correct where appropriate. Good writers use both.

    If punctuation is something you’ve generally avoided thinking about, here’s a challenge: sit down all by yourself and go through a few paragraphs of a book you like and admire and just study the punctuation. What’s the author doing, why did she break that sentence that way, why did she want a pause there, how much of the rhythm of the prose is actually established by the punctuation, how’s it done?

    Those of us who were brought up to be unaggressive in conversation are liable to use qualifiers—adjectives and adverbs such as <em>rather</em>, <em>a little</em>, which soften or weaken the words they modify. In conversation they’re OK; in written prose they’re bloodsuckers—ticks. You have to dig them out right away. The ticks I myself am plagued by are <em>kind of</em>, <em>sort of</em>, and <em>just</em>—and always, always <em>very</em>. You might just kind of take a little look at your own writing to see if you might have some very favorite qualifiers that you kind of, like, use just a little too often.

    If it comes up at all, the choice of whether to write a piece of fiction in first person or third person is a big one. Sometimes you never have to give a thought to what person to tell a story in. But sometimes a story you start telling as I gets stuck, and what it needs is to get out of the first person; sometimes a story that starts out with he said or she went needs to get out of the third person into the I voice. When a story keeps sticking or gets stuck, keep the possibility of that change of person in mind.

    Strengths and weaknesses of present tense
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Steering the Craft - Ursula  K. Le Guin</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    I see the big difference between the past and present tenses not as immediacy but as complexity and size of field. A story told in the present tense is necessarily focused on action in a single time and therefore a single place. Use of the past tense(s) allows continual referring back and forth in time and space. That’s how our minds normally work, moving around easily. Only in emergency situations do they focus very tightly on what’s going on. And so narration in the present tense sets up a kind of permanent artificial emergency, which can be exactly the right tone for fast-paced action. The past tense can also focus tightly, but it always gives access to time before and after the moment of the narrative. The moment it describes is a moment continuous with its past and its future. The difference is like the difference between a narrow-beam flashlight and sunlight. One shows a small, intense, brightly lit field with nothing around it; the other shows the world.

    Avoid passive. Take responsibility
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Steering the Craft - Ursula  K. Le Guin</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    People often use the passive voice because it’s indirect, polite, unaggressive, and admirably suited to making thoughts seem as if nobody had personally thought them and deeds seem as if nobody had done them, so that nobody need take responsibility. Writers who want to take responsibility are wary of it.

[...]

If your style has been corrupted by long exposure to academese or scientific or “business English,” you may need to worry about the passive. Make sure it hasn’t seeded itself where it doesn’t belong. If it has, root it out as needed. Where it does belong, we ought to use it freely. It is one of the lovely versatilities of the verb.

    How to handle unspoke thoughts
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Steering the Craft - Ursula  K. Le Guin</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Many writers worry about how to present characters’ unspoken thoughts. Editors are likely to put thoughts into italics if you don’t stop them. Thoughts are handled exactly like dialogue, if you present them directly:   “Heavens,” Aunt Jane thought, “he’s eating that grommet!”   But in presenting characters’ thoughts you don’t have to use quotation marks, and using italics or any typographical device can overemphasize the material. Just make it clear that this bit is going on inside somebody’s head. Ways of doing so are various:   As soon as she heard Jim shout, Aunt Jane knew Fred had swallowed the grommet after all.   I just know he’s going to swallow that grommet again, Jane said to herself as she sorted buttons.   Oh, Jane thought, I do wish the old fool would hurry up and swallow that grommet!

    The choice of point(s) of view, the voice in which one narrates one’s story, can make an immense difference to the tone, the effect, even the meaning of the story. Writers often find that a story they want to tell “sticks” and won’t go right until they find the right person to tell it—whether it’s a choice between first and third person, or between the involved author and a limited third-person narrator, or between a character involved in the action and a bystander, or between one and several narrators.

  <div class='quote'>
    I define story as a narrative of events (external or psychological) that moves through time or implies the passage of time and that involves change. I define plot as a form of story that uses action as its mode, usually in the form of conflict, and that closely and intricately connects one act to another, usually through a causal chain, ending in a climax. Climax is one kind of pleasure; plot is one kind of story. A strong, shapely plot is a pleasure in itself. It can be reused generation after generation. It provides an armature for narrative that beginning writers may find invaluable. But most serious modern fictions can’t be reduced to a plot or retold without fatal loss except in their own words. The story is not in the plot but in the telling. It is the telling that moves.

This trajectory is the shape of the story as a whole. It moves always to its end, and its end is implied in its beginning.

But with a funny kind of blindness: I can see you. I’m deaf. But if you talked to me, I could understand most of what you said. Olfactory nerves mostly shorted out at the brain end.

Are you smooth—or are you bristly and gristly as I am?” He laughed on yellow teeth in red, red gums. “Old Dan is blind in a funny way.” His hand slipped down the Mouse’s vest, catching the laces. “A funny way, yes. Most people go blind in blackness. I have a fire in my eyes. I have that whole collapsing sun in my head, my visual tectum shorted wide open, jumping, leaping, sparking. It’s as though the light lashed the rods and cones of my retina to constant stimulation, balled up a rainbow and stuffed each socket full. That’s what I’m seeing now. Then you, outlined here, highlighted there, a solarized ghost across hell from me.

    Once, the Mouse had asked Leo just when New Mosque had been built. The fisherman from the Pleiades Federation—who always walked with one foot bare—had scratched his thick blond hair as they gazed at the smoky walls rising to the domes and spiking minarets. “About a thousand years ago, was. But that only a guess is.” The Mouse was looking for Leo now.

    To move a ship faster than light from star to star, you take advantage of the very twists in space, the actual distortions that matter creates in the continuum itself. To talk about the speed of light as the limiting velocity of an object is to talk about twelve or thirteen miles an hour as the limiting velocity of a swimmer in the sea. But as soon as one starts to employ the currents of the water itself, as well as the wind above, as with a sailboat, the limit vanishes.

“Show you how to play the syrynx?”

“That’s right.” There are expressions that happen on the outside of the face; there are expressions that happen on the inside, with only quivers on the lips and eyelids. “I don’t usually let people fool with my ax.” Lips and eyelids quivered.

“Show me.”

    Katin was looking through the cards he had picked up. “This is what you’ve been playing with, Tyÿ? The Tarot?” He looked up. “You’re a gypsy, Mouse. I bet you’ve seen these before.” He held the cards up so the Mouse might see.

Not looking, the Mouse nodded. He tried to keep his hand from his hip. (There had been a big woman sitting behind the fire—in the dirty print skirt—and the mustachioed men sat around under the flickering overhang of rock, watching while the cards flashed and flashed in her fat fingers. But that had been … )

“Here,” Tyÿ said. “You to me them give.” She reached.

“May I look through the whole set?” asked Katin.

Her gray eyes widened. “No.” Surprise was in her voice.

“I’m … sorry,” Katin began, confused. “I didn’t mean to …”

Tyÿ took the cards.

“You … do you read the cards?” Katin tried to keep his face from freezing.

She nodded.

From the hammock of his pelvis it clawed into his belly, vaulted his chest and wove wildly, erupted from his face. Lorq bellowed. In the sharp peripheral awareness of the drug, he saw the Mouse’s syrynx where it had been left on the stage. He snatched it up—

“No, Captain!” as Prince lunged. Lorq ducked with the instrument against his chest. He twisted the intensity knob.

The edge of Prince’s hand shattered the doorjamb (where a moment before the Mouse had leaned). Splinters split four and five feet up the shaft.

    Miki, I’m going to need to use your systems to monitor your—I almost said clients. It took almost a full second for me to be able to use the word Miki wanted to hear. —your friends. I need you to be my camera, and let me use your scanning ability. Sometimes I might need to speak through you, pretending to be you, to warn Don Abene and your friends about things I believe are dangerous. Can you let me do that? Obviously, with the access Miki had given me already, I could have taken Miki over, done what I wanted, and excised it all from its memory. I had done it to Ship, but Ship was a low-level bot and didn’t have enough self-awareness to give a shit. Doing that to Miki … But I didn’t know what I would do if it said no. Miki said, Okay, I will do that, Consultant Rin. That sounds scary, but I want to make sure no one hurts my friends. This felt way too easy. I almost suspected a trap. Or … Miki, have you been directed to reply to every query with a yes? No, Consultant Rin, Miki said, and added, amusement sigil 376 = smile. Or Miki was a bot who had never been abused or lied to or treated with anything but indulgent kindness. It really thought its humans were its friends, because that’s how they treated it. I signaled Miki I would be withdrawing for one minute. I needed to have an emotion in private.

    I accelerated as the hatch entrance to the engineering pod came into sight. I reached the end of the corridor at top speed and threw myself forward into a dive. The hub foyer was now a warzone. I hit the floor and slid out across it. The combat bot nearest the door flailed wildly at the cloud of drones firing and diving at it. It thrashed around like an irritated metal whirlwind, stray blasts from its weapons hitting the walls, the floor, the columns. It smacked a drone with its cutting hand and shrapnel sprayed the room. I’d tuned down my pain sensors in anticipation, but I still felt impacts all over my back and shoulders, little thumps that I knew meant something had cut through my clothes and pierced my skin. (Does that sound terrifying? Because it was terrifying.) The second bot tried to run forward but the drones made a wall and slammed into it, forcing it back with a haze of weapon fire and their own armored bodies.

    I poked cautiously through the feed, wondering if I’d been fooled. I had the ability to scan, but without drones my range was limited, and with all the shielding and equipment around me I couldn’t pick up anything but background readings from the ship’s systems. Whoever owned the ship wanted to allow for proprietary research; the only security cameras were on the hatches, nothing in the crew areas. Or nothing I could access. But the presence in the feed was too big and diffuse for a human or augmented human, I could tell that much even through the feed walls protecting it. And it sounded like a bot. When humans speak in the feed, they have to subvocalize and their mental voice tends to sound like their physical voice. Even augmented humans with full interfaces do it.

    After three episodes, I was calmer and reluctantly beginning to see the transport’s perspective. A SecUnit could cause it a lot of internal damage if it wasn’t careful, and rogue SecUnits were not exactly known for lying low and avoiding trouble. I hadn’t hurt the last transport I had taken a ride on, but it didn’t know that. I didn’t understand why it had let me aboard, if it really didn’t want to hurt me. I wouldn’t have trusted me, if I was a transport. Maybe it was like me, and it had taken an opportunity because it was there, not because it knew what it wanted. It was still an asshole, though. Six episodes later I felt the transport in the feed again, lurking. I ignored it, though it had to know I knew it was there. In human terms, it was like trying to ignore someone large and breathing heavily while they watched your personal display surface over your shoulder. While leaning on you.

    ComfortUnits are more physically powerful than a human, but not a SecUnit or bot. They had no inbuilt weapons, and while they could pick up a projectile or energy weapon and use it, they had no education modules on how the weapons worked. They could pick one up, try to aim it, pull the trigger, and hope the safety wasn’t engaged. One by one the file downloads had stopped. One had signaled that it would try to decoy SecUnit attention away from the others, and three acknowledged. One had heard screams from the control center and diverted there to try to save the humans trapped inside, and two acknowledged. One had stayed at the entrance to a corridor to try to buy time to reach SecSystem, and one acknowledged. One reported reaching SecSystem, then nothing.

    Part of it is, they didn’t want me here. Not here in their hub, but here on the planet.

    “SecUnit, your opinion.” Fortunately, I had one now. Up to the point where we’d gotten the drone download, my opinion had been mostly oh, shit. I said, “They have nothing to lose. If we come to this rendezvous, they can kill us and stop worrying about us. If we don’t, they have until the end of project date to search for us.” Gurathin was reviewing the landing video now. He said, “Another indication it isn’t the company. They obviously don’t want to chase us until the end of project date.” I said, “I told you it wasn’t the company.” Mensah interrupted Gurathin before he could respond. “They think we know why they’re here, why they’re doing this.” “They’re wrong,” Ratthi said, frustrated. Mensah’s brow furrowed as she picked apart the problem for the other humans. “But why do they think that? It must be because they know we went to one of the unmapped regions. That means the data we collected must have the answer.” Pin-Lee nodded. “So the others may know by now.” “It gives us leverage,” Mensah said thoughtfully. “But what can we do with it?” And then I had a great idea.

SO AT THE APPOINTED time the next day, Mensah and I were flying toward the rendezvous point.

    As we left the rocky slope and turned into the trees, the brush and branches screening us from the edge of the plateau, I slung an arm around the other Unit’s neck, deployed my arm weapon, and fired into the side of its helmet where its comm channel was. It went down on one knee, swinging its projectile weapon toward me, energy weapons unfolding out of its armor. With the combat override module in place, its feed was cut off, and with its comm down it couldn’t yell for help. Also, depending on how strictly they had limited its voluntary actions, it might not be able to call for help unless the GrayCris humans told it to. Maybe that was the case, because all it did was try to kill me. We rolled over rock and brush until I wrenched its weapon away. After that it was easy to finish it off. Physically easy. I know I said SecUnits aren’t sentimental about each other, but I wished it wasn’t one of the DeltFall units. It was in there somewhere, trapped in its own head, maybe aware, maybe not. Not that it matters. None of us had a choice.

    Reed remembered what he’d done. “Are you feeling alright, Phil?” He paused. “Should I even still call you that?”

“I’m feeling, and in and of itself that’s quite wonderful. Just a second.” The channel on the television changed. “Sorry, I’ve seen that. And yes, Phil is still alright. We should be careful. We might slip up calling me anything else in front of the wrong person.”

“Sure, I understand.” Reed straightened. “Wait&mdash;you said you’d seen that show before. That means?”

“Yes.” Warmth in his voice. “I can remember everything. All my blocks are quite down and no longer functional. I was emailing daily reports this morning and the strangest thought occurred to me&mdash;I hate mailing reports. Isn’t that crazy? I send out thousands every day, and for the first time I have an opinion on whether I like to do it.”

    Whatever, I was walking through the park and passed this guy who was on something. I wasn’t looking for it; I just noticed it– noticed so hard that my head snapped around on my neck.

The guy looked normal; maybe a little red around the eyes. Nothing that would ordinarily stand out. He paused at my stare. “What?”

“Nothing.” I couldn’t look away. “Sky-flower? Is that what you’re taking?”

The guy’s eyes widened. “How do you know? It hasn’t even kicked in yet.”

“I don’t know.” I was bewildered myself. “It’s like I can smell it.”

“Sky-flower doesn’t smell.”

“I know.”

The guy frowned at me, then sort of drifted off along his original course. A few steps later, I glanced over my shoulder to see the Sky-flower dude doing the same. I waved to show I was friendly and continued on my way. For the first time, I was conscious of the lump in my armpit. It seemed to have grown slightly.

“Did you do that?” I murmured in its direction.

Of course it didn’t answer. How does an organized mass of alien tissue respond to a question? It didn’t have a mouth. There was a scary image. Would it try to hijack my brain? There had been those dreams, disturbing misty landscapes and the sound of distant footfalls, or mechanical thumps like vibrations through the earth. Was that my vestigial brain trying to think?

    The green outfit was doing a great job of highlighting Jade’s form every time we passed a streetlamp. I still couldn’t see where she could be hiding anything in there. When we paused at an intersection, I asked, “Where’s yours?”

Jade anxiously waited for the traffic to clear. “Where’s my what?”

“Your... mass. You know, the alien.” I looked her over again. “I assume you have one.”

“Not exactly.”

“Then how do you know about the blue labels?”

The tram passed and she plucked my arm. “Keep moving.”

We jogged down the street. “You’re telling me you don’t have an alien lump?”

It was dark, but I swear she blushed. “I’m saying that I don’t have one.”

When the truth hit, it was all I could do to smother my laugh. Speaking carefully, I said, “I thought you looked a little more... buxom, than the last time I saw you.”

“Yeah, my existing lumps just got bigger. And thank you for being delicate. I’m probably the only person on this planet who has a pair of self-aware tits.”

“Gives a whole new meaning to the term ‘headlights’.”

“Yeah. I’m literally following their lead at the moment.”

I didn’t want to know the details of that little communication. “Don’t they… hurt?”

She looked startled. “Why would they?”

“Someone grabbed my armpit today, and I practically passed out.”

“Do people often grab your armpits?”

I admitted the obvious. “I’m a wrestler.”

Her eyebrows rose. “Really?”

I shrugged. “Someone has to be.”

I looked her over again, then down at Frank, sprawled before me. I had to admit, they both looked pretty terrific. I suddenly remembered what Doc had said, about my vitals being their best ever. Maybe… maybe this health thing was true.

    What’s interesting is that, after our first 10,000 customers or so, the marshlands on Anabic B began to hold their own. When our network doubled in size, they even began to recover. Frank’s brother thinks it has something to do with the group mind being able to communicate across the lightyears to its thriving colony. He’s planning to enroll us in a program to test long-distance communication at faster-than-light speeds. If it works, it could prove to be what you might call an unanticipated win. Cross-galaxy communication, via spore phone. The potential gains are keeping the military off our backs, which is another plus.

And Jade and me? They don’t call her Supertits for nothing. We’re always developing new fitness routines if you know what I mean. Mean and Clean, and our fungus machine, appear to be working out very well.

    Ed remembered seventy-eight years ago when the Venezuelans had nabbed him. He was a real kid back then, in a body two years older than this one now and a lot more scared. Those Venezuelans were real pros. He had lost a pinky to their sharp knives so they could box it up and express mail it to his father.

Speaking of fingers, it was almost time. While distracting the kidnapper with futile pulls in his puny, eight-year-old body, Ed had slowly worked at the hand clamping his mouth. As long as Ed didn’t make too much noise, the kidnapper had no reason to reposition. Now Ed’s mouth, one of the strongest muscles in his new body, was poised around the kidnapper’s finger. This was his real escape plan.

Ed bit for freedom.

    Why would this woman be after the husk of her former son? She had snuck into the Playhouse, she had to know that the first six years of her baby’s life were spent getting neuropathways mapped and loaded with a lifetime of memories.

“I don’t get it,” Ed said. “She has to know her baby’s long gone.”

Ed remembered the research that made him buy the kid in the first place. Neuroplasticity, or the ability for a brain to grow and organize neural pathways, was the highest in an infant’s brain. This made babies not just the best option for complete personality mind grafts, but the only option.

He recalled that first year as a newborn, technically his eighty-first year alive, as little more than a barrage of flashing lights and spastic starbursts. Then the memories started getting in, growing exponentially until he had a full eighty years worth of Edward Rothschild Lewis. It took awhile to download close to three thousand terabytes of human memory information, but now that it was downloaded, there was no going back.

    Backfill is basically expository background, explaining who these people are and how they got into this mess in the first place. It can be handled in two ways: as straight exposition in the author’s voice, or as a sort of pseudoreminiscence in the voice of the point-of-view character.

    Will this backfill slow down the story? Yes. Will it slow down the story too much? That’s a judgement call, but here’s a guideline to help you make it: the Swimming Pool Theory. This theory says that structuring fiction is like kicking off from the side of a swimming pool. The stronger and more forceful your initial kick, the longer you can glide through the water. The stronger and more forceful your opening scene, the less your reader will mind a “glide” through nondramatized backfill.

  <div class='quote'>
    A writer always pays a price for flashbacks. Any flashback, no matter how well written or interesting, will distance your reader from the action. This is because flashbacks shatter the illusion that the reader is a fly on the wall, witnessing events as they happen, right now. The flashback is not happening right now—it is, by definition, already over. Are you more thrilled by a kiss you experience today or one you remember from a year ago? Flashbacks are not as immediate as story time. Even so, the flashback can be a good choice for a second scene if you gain more in depth and clarity than you lose in immediacy.

Got any apple?” “The diet plate, the one with cottage cheese and a pear half and tea with lemon and … and … oh, hell, and a banana split.” “I don’t suppose you have any pie that’s really home-baked?” “Is the chicken free-range? Is the zucchini grown organically? Don’t you know?” Do you have different impressions of each of these characters?

  <div class='quote'>
    A short story with two characters is certainly possible, but it, too, isn’t easy. Often the two characters get into some snarl or problem, each becomes locked into his position, and you have an impasse. Introducing a third character can provide the catalyst to get things moving again. The third character does something that forces one, or both, of the originals to react, altering his position.

  <div class='quote'>
    Set aside an hour or two. During that time, write several short openings to the same story, writing very rapidly, keeping each to between three and five paragraphs. Don’t try to consciously judge these openings. Instead, keep producing variations by deliberately altering either narrative mode or point of entrance into the story (more on this to come). Once you’ve done this a few times, you’ll become quite adept at producing these by simply moving methodically through the possibilities. And, inevitably, one of the variations will click in your mind, and you’ll feel that sense of Tightness and eagerness—“Yes, this is it!”—that is one of the major pleasures of writing fiction.

  <div class='quote'>
    Every story makes a promise to the reader. Actually, two promises, one emotional and one intellectual, since the function of stories is to make us both feel and think. The emotional promise goes: Read this and you’ll be entertained, or thrilled, or scared, or titillated, or saddened, or nostalgic, or uplifted—but always absorbed. There are three versions of the intellectual promise. The story can promise (1) Read this and you’ll see this world from a different perspective; (2) Read this and you’ll have confirmed what you already want to believe about this world; or (3) Read this and you’ll learn of a different, more interesting world than this. The last promise, it should be noted, can exist on its own or coexist with either of the first two.

    Whatever the tone of your story—comic, serious, reportorial, ironic—the credible writer doesn’t allow it to become self-indulgent. The focus should be on the story, not on the writer. This means resisting the impulse to overwrite through clever asides, through telling how important this all is (as opposed to showing us), through language too grandiose for the situation, through throwing in pointless foreign words or “in” slang, or through insistent punctuation (“Then the car slammed into the wall!!”)

  <div class='quote'>
    The first scene of your short story shouldn’t be a summary scene. In fact, scene one can’t be a scene in which the situation doesn’t change, because the job of scene one is to give us the initial situation. Anything you tell us is going to be a change from what we knew at the start of the story—nothing—and therefore the first scene should be dramatized. You can, of course, just have your characters stand around discussing a situation they’re all already familiar with but we’re not. However, the first scene will be much more interesting—and much easier to write—if something is different at the end of the scene than existed at the beginning.

    To succeed, your prologue must contain a strong promise of conflict to come.

In Crichton’s prologue to Jurassic Park, for example, a construction worker is severely mauled by an unidentified animal that, the cover picture indicates, will turn out to be a dinosaur—in contemporary Costa Rica.

    It’s well worth spending considerable time rewriting and polishing that first scene. You’ll greatly increase the chances of an editor finishing your story. And if you are one of those writers who stops to polish before going on to scene two, you’ll gain a dividend. You will have made writing the rest of the story or novel much easier on yourself. This is because you now have a firmer idea of who your character is, what the conflict will be, and what the tone of the story will be. You have, by your first scene, committed to certain directions for each of these. Knowing that can keep you from wandering into different directions.

He always wore a tie to the college. Let the students—and graduate students, at that!—come to class in ripped jeans and obscene T-shirts and hair tangled as if colonized by rats. Even the girls. Students were students, and Henry didn’t consider their sloppiness disrespectful, the way so many did at St. Sebastian’s. Sometimes he was even amused by it, in a sad sort of way. Didn’t these intelligent, sometimes driven, would-be physicists know how ephemeral their beauty was? Why did they go to such lengths to look unappealing, when soon enough that would be their only choice?

This time he got the tie knotted. Not perfectly—a difficult operation, one-handed—but close enough for government work. He smiled. When he and his colleagues had been doing government work, only perfection was good enough. Atomic bombs were like that. Henry could still hear Oppie’s voice saying the plans for Ivy Mike were “technically sweet.” Of course, that was before all the—

  <div class='quote'>
    If anything has become more and more clear in the past five hundred years, it is that men and women are not the <em>measure</em> of all things, but the <em>measurers</em>. A richer, more powerful literature must take into account the nature of larger entities than human individuals.

There’s nothing that stops science fiction&mdash;often dismissed as merely a literature of ideas&mdash;from also being a literature of character, so long as readers understand a larger definition of character. Character is not limited to the nature and actions of a single individual, or even a group of individuals. Character may also describe a nation, a culture, a species, a world&mdash;or a universe.

    Characterization: dramatic vs explicit
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Paragons - Robin Wilson</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    The writer characterizes thorugh two basic methods, the <em>explicit</em> and the <em>dramatic</em>. The choice between the two seems to follow a kind of faddish cycle, with James’ reaction to the explicit techniques of the nineteenth century novel expressed in his exhortation to “Dramatize! Dramatize!” now appearing in writers workshops as “Show, don’t tell!” But the pendulum swings, and if the explicit method is not yet in vogue, it is holding its own. The writer who chooses the explicit method of characterization has limited her choice of point of view (she requires omniscience or a third-person narrator), but she has two powerful tools: the <em>essay method</em>, concentrated expository character portraits, and the <em>method of progressive analysis</em>, a running commentary on the actions and motivations of the character.

The dramatic (or implicit) method of characterizationrequires that the character be revealed through the opinions of other characters, through his interactions with his environment, and through his acted-out attitudes toward others.

    Characters are bound in a story by <em>quantity</em> and <em>function</em>
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Paragons - Robin Wilson</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Characters are presented in accord with two judgments the writer must make: the <em>quantity</em> of information about the character the reader must have and the <em>function</em> of the charater in the story. The quantitative decision is particularly important in short fiction, where every word must count, and the writer&mdash;who is as interested in her creations as any fond parent&mdash;must struggle against prolixity. The functional decision helps to determine the quantitative one by distinguishing between central and marginal characters. But even here, the writer who plots by the “plant some characters in a situation and see what grows” method is likely to see some unimportant little sprout suddenly develop great leaves and strong tentacles threatening to strangle the rest of the tale.

    Functioning characters are not stock items, carefully labeled and stored on shelves in the writer’s mind until she needs them. Instead they are meticulously constructed within the framework of their stories, imagined in a depth and detail that usually surpasses the demands of the drama they act out. They are, of course, modeled after life; a writer has no other source for her knowledge of behavior or motivation.

    There are reasons why science fiction and fantasy writers try so hard to inject surprise into their plots&mdash;particularly into their endings. We’re writing popular literature here; surprise may be the most special of our effects. And it’s part of out heritage. After all, we’re the folks who gave Western Civilization <em>Amazing</em> and <em>Astounding</em>. Surprises sustain and even enhance the reader’s interest in a developing plot.

  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    Some writers are assiduous planners; I am not one of them. In fact the outline is probably the rustiest tool in my kit. Of course, different projects require different strategies. I wouldn’t launch into a novel without making notes, timelines, and character sketches; complex, episodic stories sprawling over someone’s entire lifetime might require a diagram. But in general, my approach to plotting is to procrastinate. I don’t necessarily want to work out everything that’s going to happen ahead of time. Whenever possible, I prefer to wait until I can collaborate with my characters. I ruefully acknowledge that this isn’t the most efficient way to write, but it’s what works for me.

  <div class='quote'>
    This morning the monster was cagy. It wanted to get loose and he was tired of holding it back. Something was going to happen.

[...]

The walls were shaggy with pictures he’d ripped out of magazines but he didn’t look at them. Not yet. He pressed the <em>play</em> button on the boom box and the Rolling Stones bongoed into “Sympathy for the Devil.” He knelt at the oak chest which served as the altar. Inside was a plastic box. Inside the box, cradled in pink velvet, was the Beretta.

[...]

He locked the shrine behind him and went back to the mirror, the only thing he’d kept when he closed his dad’s house. The creature leered at him. He stuck out his thumb and smudged his reflected eye. The hair on the back of his neck prickled. He thought then he knew what was going to happen. It wanted to touch someone else and he was going to let it.

[...]

“<em>Henry</em>.” Jerry spun toward him in desperation. “You can’t let this happen. He’ll make you do both out jobs, Henry. Tell him you need help.”

Henry was certain that if he opened his mouth the monster would leap out and strangle them all.

[...]

...he didn’t really hate her. Yes, the grotesque hump repelled him and she had the personality of a Brillo but he was also a little sorry for her.

It was the monster that hated her.

    Seeing the closed eyes, the long white fingers tender on the white temples, Bux said, “I said I was sorry I yelled like that.”

“In every city,” said the Archive Master patiently, “on every settled human planet in all the known universe, there is a free public clinic where stress reactions of any sort may be diagnosed, treated or prescribed for, speedily, effectively, and with dignity. I trust you will not regard it as an intrusion on your privacy if I make the admittedly non-professional observation (you see, I do not pretend to be a therapist) that there are times when a citizen is not himself aware that he is under stress, even though it may be clearly, perhaps painfully obvious to others. It would not be a discourtesy, would it, or an unkindness, for some understanding stranger to suggest to such a citizen that&mdash;”

“What you’re saying, all wrapped up in words, is I ought to go have my head candled.”

“By no means. I am not qualified. I did, however, think that a visit to a clinic&mdash;there’s one just a step away from here&mdash;might make&mdash;ah&mdash;communications between us more possible. I would be glad to arrange another appointment for you, when you’re feeling better. That is to say, when you are... ah...” He finished with a bleak smile and reached toward the calling stud.

Moving almost like a Drive-ship, Bux seemed to cease to exist on the visitor’s chair and reappeared instantaneously at the side of the desk, a long thick arm extended and a meaty hand blocking the way to the stud. “Hear me out first,” he said, softly. Really softly. It was a much more astonishing thing than if the Archive Master had trumpeted like an elephant. “Hear me out. Please.”

The old man withdrew his hand, but folded it with the other and set the neat stack of fingers on the edge of the desk. It looked like stubbornness.

    There are questions I use to [reason out the ending].

One such question is: How do I want the protagonist to end up changed by the events of the story? Knowing that can sometimes help the writerwork backward. This is the way events changed him&mdash;what events do I need to bring about such a change? That’s the climax.

[...]

A second question to help figure out endings is: Who won and who lost? This derives from a useful metaphor about fiction, which is that every story&mdash;every single one, from <em>Hamlet</em>, to <em>The Meatloaf that Ate Toledo</em>&mdash; is a war.

  <div class='quote'>
    Aren’t <strong>all</strong> scenes supposed to advance plot?

Not necessarily. The Kress Swimming Pool Theory of Fiction comes into play here. This theory says that scene order is like kicking off from the side of a swimming pool. The harder the initial kick, the longer and further you can glide. A first scene with conflict and action and rapid introduction of new information earns you the right to a slower following scene that adds backfill and focuses on comparative subtleties of tone, character, setting, or motif. Scene two of “Oranges” is all exposition.

    <em>One Damn Thing After Another - Nancy Kress</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    “Character is plot,” said Henry James, who did pretty well with both. My translation of this is “Why are these people doing what they’re doing?” Understanding the motivations of all your major characters, not just the protagonist, can suggest plot developments. Plot and character&mdash;the double helix of fiction. So, I asked myself, the man that Harry snares and forcibly brings back to 1989&mdash;what does <strong>that</strong> character want?

Not Jackie. Or the story would be over.

Okay, start here. He doesn’t want Jackie. Why not? Because their personalities clash. Because the man has a life in his own time. Because he’s married. Yes&mdash;that would fit with poor Harry’s attempts: well-meaning but inept. After all, if Harry were good at time travel, he’d bring back not oranges but stock certificates, and end up rich. Harry, however, is not that sort of man (“Plot is character”). Harry, even when ating out of love, screws up (“Plot is one damned thing after another”).

    <div class='note'>
      This is a great question to ask when developing plot. Find where the dead-end is (“or the story would be over”) and work in the opposite direction.

    <em>Normal tempo</em> is the conventional balance between the realistic slowness of most human happenings and the need to compress these happenings to fit the limitations of the reader’s patience. <em>Retarded tempo</em> expands time, often to a pace far slower than real time, to allow the writer to examine events in great details.

[...]

<em>Accelerated tempo</em> is the pace of the action-adventure tale or the documentary history, the furious rush of events the leaves the hero (and the reader) breathless. Tempo is not necessarily uniform throughout the story; its variation in conformity with the author’s intentions is part of his craft, something he achieves as much through stylistics devices as through his selection and arrangement of events in the plot.

    Perhaps this interesting tradition of communal artistic enterprise results from the very nature of science, the essenece of art, and their curious union in science fiction. French scientist Claude Bernard, who was a so-so playwrite but a world-renowned Third Republic physiologist, put it this way:

“Art,” he wrote, “is I; science is we.”

Perhaps the melding of these two in our genre has hatched the idea of the (perforce) lone artist working within a network of supportive colleagues and mentors which seems to be such an integral part of the American science fiction scene.

    She watched him through half-closed eyes. She was sleek and poised in french jeans and a golden leotard, her hair tied up in a scarf with just a few strands floating free around her face.

She had not always been so confident. Tony had met Diane three years before, when she was a drama student, working part-time at the steakhouse that he managed. One afternoon, her car had refused to start and she was late for an audition. Tony had driven her to the audition and she had cried on his shoulder when the director gave the part to another girl. A week later, he celebrated with her when she got a part in another play. Eventually she moved into the house in the Berkeley hills. For two years, they had lived together happily. She had needed him then: for reassurance, for comfort.

He claimed that she had stopped loving him the day she was mentioned favorably in a review. She had changed: lost weight, learned to use makeup. She had turned into a slim-hipped, honey-tanned California girl with a laugh like the sound of Almaden Mountain Rhine wine pouring into a tumbler&mdash;sweet but a little vulgar. A lady with a mind like a racing car engine. Not a Swiss watch&mdash;this lady was built for power.

She had started bringing her actor friends home: people with names like Vancouver John and the Lizard King. That’s when the fights started.

“You don’t spend time with me anymore,” he had complained. “You’re too busy with your friends.”

“That’s not true and you know it. You’re just feeling sorry for yourself. I’m doing things I want to do and you resent that. You wanted me to stay the way I was&mdash;a shy, weak, little girl. You wanted me to...”

“I wanted a woman I could love.”

“You wanted a woman who wouldn’t change.”

When Diane got a chance to tour with a traveling company she and Tony agreed&mdash;in a reasonable, calm fashion&mdash;that their life together had come to an end.

Now she was back.

    “Stupidity. Stupidity’s always been a capital crime. If you had to get yourself executed, why not for something important? See the kid on the other side of you?”

“Sure,” Lew said without looking.

“He’s an organlegger.” Lew felt the shock freezing in his face. He braced himself for another look into the next cell&mdash; and every nerve in his body jumped. The kid was looking at him. With his dull dark eyes barely visible under his mop of hair, he regarded Lew as a butcher might consider a badly aged side of beef. Lew edged closer to the bars between his cell and the old man’s.

His voice was a hoarse whisper. “How many did he kill?”

“None.”

“?”

“He was the snatch man. He’d find someone out alone at night, drug the prospect and take him home to the doc that ran the ring. It was the doc that did all the killing. If Bernie’d brought home a dead prospect, the doc would have skinned him down.”

    He put his hand over his heart, the place where the priest’s word used to rest. Where did nonattachment fit into all this?

He found it easier to keep his balance as he walked through the herd if he kept his eyes closed. And he found it easier to keep going if he imagined telling her about it later.

<em>Isla, I was so scared and I just kept walking. It was the only thing I knew how to do.</em>

Gradually, the texture of the ground beneath his bare feet began to change. It became coarser and cooler and even a little moist. Javi hoped for some kind of shore, but didn’t believe it until cool water began to lap at his toes. He kept walking forward and didn’t open his eyes until he was waist deep. He was in a lake.

    In the dark, he felt he had escaped his own body. He imagined telling Isla how he died when he met her in the next life. <em>I walked into wasps in order to find you.</em>

He would tell her how the little wasps dissolved his clothes and his pack and the water he had brought with him spilled on the barren ground, but still he walked towards her. Then the medium-sized wasps began to land on him, and they didn’t quite sting, it was more like an embrace that covered him. The wasps began to spread out their mechanical bodies until they covered every inch of him, even his eyes and his mouth, and he could not breathe and they tightened their embrace. It did not hurt and he felt like he was flying and that it might have been a good way to die if not for all the fear.

    The instructions were to walk along the golden mean segment that connected two vertices of the pentagon. Javi had been told you had to be naked in order to see it. While he didn’t believe this, he didn’t want to disrespect the customs of those who did, so he walked there wearing boots and socks and nothing else. Isla should be with him now, sharing his kombucha. It was raspberry, her favorite flavor. He found himself narrating the event in his head in anticipation of telling it to Isla the next time he saw her: <em>There were other people on the same path. Some had binoculars. I wished I had also brought binoculars. A crowd gathered. That’s how I knew the deer had been spotted.</em>

    He rode to the suburb from the north. To his left, dawn was breaking, sending the first pearl-coloured streaks into the sky. He had been travelling through the night, following the freeway, but it had ended abruptly, buried under an old landslide. He had turned aside to pick his way through the thin patch of scrubby bush.

  He knew he had reached the suburb when the vegetation gave way suddenly to the stubborn concrete of a shopping center’s parking lot. It stretched ahead of him, an immense open space. Nothing moved. He turned his attention to the remaining giant letters above him. Once they had made up part of the center’s name. Now they hung askew, their bolts corroded through.

  He pulled out one of his street maps, and opened it. The position was marked. He checked the nearby street names, then carefully folded the tattered paper and replaced it in his pack. With a low clicking of his tongue he urged the tired horse on, toward the center of the suburb.

  His mount picked its way carefully over the cracked concrete while he studied his surroundings.

  A rusted shopping cart lay to one side, stripped of its wheels. Small arcades branched off from the main building. Most windows were broken, the shelves emptied of useful items. A china shop stood undamaged; its painted plates and figurines glittering richly in the rays of the rising sun, while next door a furniture shop still boasted a discount on the deflated water bed in the window.

  Silence hung over the morning. The birds were learning not to sing.

  The bounty hunter turned his gaze toward the approaching streets and houses. Grass and weed clogged the gutters, and broke up the bitumen. Where street signs remained, they were barely legible; in some places, they were missing completely. The houses were unoccupied; engulfed in flowering bushes, roofs sagging. He expected that. They mostly clustered in the centers of the suburbs now, close to the government supplies.

  A sudden movement sent his hand darting for the rifle slung over his shoulder. In a flurry of ruffled feathers and frightened peeping, a wild duck and two ducklings burst from the grass onto the open road.

    The Transport Union representative who was processing their paperwork handed Holden an oversized terminal covered in legalese. She had a pinched face, deep frown lines on her forehead and around her mouth, and wore her hair in short spikes dyed flaming red. Holden thought she looked like a disgruntled puffer fish, but recognized his unflattering opinion was at least partly a reaction to the mountain of forms she’d made him fill out.

“You do know,” the puffer fish said, “that this is a temporary change of status, pending the legal change-of-ownership registration?”

“Our next stop is the bank, where we’ll be finalizing the loan to sell the ship.”

“Mmhmm,” Puffer said, making it a sound of deep skepticism.

    The other two OPA goons were flanking Bobbie, and one of them was holding the crowbar he’d just cracked her cheekbone with. In the sort of slow-motion clarity Bobbie always experienced during a fight, she saw skin and blood on the crowbar’s edge.

<em>Oh</em>, she thought, <em>that’s why my face feels wet.</em>

Crowbar was pulling back for another swing, while his partner tried to get behind her. Bobbie decided Crowbar was the more serious threat and lunged at him to get inside the arc of his swing. His arm went around her, and she felt the bar slam into her shoulder blade, which made her right arm go pins-and-needles numb. She threw a throat punch at him with it, and even though she couldn’t feel it, her arm did what she told it to. Crowbar dropped his weapon and clutched his throat with both hands, gagging.

    I’ve always tried to avoid infodumps; when I can’t see any way to avoid them, I try to make them less boring by inserting them into a more dramatic context. So a first draft conversation around a conference table ends up taking place during an invasive and painful decontamination procedure in the final version. Someone who starts off pondering the biochemistry of a certain microbe while sitting in a chair might, by the time the book makes it into print, find herself being forced to work through the same questions under torture. Anything to avoid endless pages of talking heads spouting facts at each other.
