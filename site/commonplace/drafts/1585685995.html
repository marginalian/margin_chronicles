      <h1>Niklas Luhmann's Conversations with his Slipbox</h1>
      <p>Context. He treats his slipbox as a communication partner, and refers to it by personal pronouns (they, them, us).</p>
      <p>When designing a note taking system, there is a immediate choice: build up a strict categorization system or combine all the notes together.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>If a communicative system is to hold together for a longer period, we must choose either the route of highly technical specialization or that of incorporating randomness and information generated ad hoc. Applied to collections of notes, we can choose the route of thematic specialization ( such as notes about governmental liability) or we can choose the route of an open organization. We decided for the latter. After more than twenty-six years of successful and only occasionally difficult co-operation, we can now vouch for the success or at least the viability of this approach.</div><div class='single-blockquote'>Naturally, the route that creates a partner in communication that is meant for the long haul, is open, and not thematically limited</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>He argues for a different kind of structure:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>For the inner life of the card index, for the arrangement of notes or its mental history, it is most important that we decide against the systematic ordering in accordance with topics and sub-topics and choose instead a firm fixed place (Stellordnung). A system based on content, like the outline of a book) would mean that we make a decision that would bind us to a certain order for decades in advance! This necessarily leads very quickly to problems of placement, if we consider the system of communication and ourselves as capable of development. The fixed filing place needs no system. It is sufficient that we give every slip a number which is easily seen (in or case on the left of the first line) and that we never change this number and thus the fixed place of the slip.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>He advocates for structuring the notes as a tree, where note number 1 is at the top. Note number 1/1 is a linear thematic continuation of the first note (it may even be a literal continuation where a long thought or quote is broken mid sentence between two cards.) A note with number 1/1a would be a branch off of 1/1. It may be an aside, a summary, a tangent.</p>
      <p>I prefer that this kind of work be done in a wiki format. In other words, I prefer to loosely organize reading notes inside very large thematic buckets and to keep annotations very short and keyword rich to improve searchability. Then, to use wiki pages to undertake the work of linking the notes together and "communicating" with them through extended marginalia.</p>
      <p>However, MMX does borrow from his idea of linking notes together.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Since all papers have fixed numbers, you can add as many references to them as you may want. Central concepts can have many links which show on which other contexts we can find materials relevant for them. Through references, we can, without too much work or paper, solve the problem of multiple storage. Given this technique, it is less important where we place a new note. If there are several possibilities, we can solve the problem as we wish and just record the connection by a link [or reference]. Often the context in which we are working suggests a multiplicity of links to other notes. This is especially the case when the card index is already voluminous. In such cases it is important to capture the connections radially, as it were, but at the same time also by right away recording back links in the slips that are being linked to. In this working procedure, the content that we take note of is usually also enriched.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>He also created a register system to help with rediscovery of notes. Here he kept a list of keywords and referenced the applicable notes. With a digital system, this burden is easily shouldered by search. This is one benefit of keeping all the notes together in a plaintext database format.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>As a result of extensive work with this technique a kind of secondary memory will arise, an alter ego with who we can constantly communicate. It proves to be similar to our own memory in that it does not have a thoroughly constructed order of its entirety, not hierarchy, and most certainly no linear structure like a book. Just because of this, it gets its own life, independent of its author. The entirety of these notes can only be described as a disorder, but at the very least it is a disorder with non-arbitrary internal structure. Some things will get lost (versickern), some notes we will never see again. On the other hand, there will be preferred centers, formation of lumps and regions with which we will work more often than with others. There will be complexes of ideas that are conceived at large, but which will never be completed; there will be incidental ideas which started as links from secondary passages and which are continuously enriched and expand so that they will tend increasingly to dominate system. To sum up: this technique guarantees that its order which is merely formal does not become a hindrance but adapts to the conceptual development</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>He also describes the importance of keeping all his notes connected through links and structure:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Every note is only an element which receives its quality only from the network of links and back-links within the system. A note that is not connected to this network will get lost in the card file and ill be forgotten by it. Its rediscovery depends on accidents and on the vagary that this rediscovery means something at the time it is found.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>The system can transform:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class='single-blockquote'>Naturally, independence presupposes a minimal measure of intrinsic complexity. The slip box needs a number of years in order to reach critical mass. Until then, it functions as a mere container from which we can retrieve what we put in. This changes with its growth in size and complexity. On the one hand, the number of approaches and occasions for questions increases. The slip box becomes a universal instrument. You can place almost everything in it, and this not just ad hoc and in isolation, but with internal possibilities of connections [with other contents]. It becomes a sensitive system that internally reacts to many ideas, as long as they can be noted down</div>
