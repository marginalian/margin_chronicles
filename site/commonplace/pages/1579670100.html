      <h1>Thoreau's Praise of Classic Books</h1>
      <p>It's easy to become swept up in the timestamp frenzy of the internet, where recent is the same as relevant. Taking a break from the feed is anxiety-provoking&mdash;if you're not keeping up, you're falling behind. This is not a modern problem. More than 170 years ago, Henry David Thoreau wrote that "Men sometimes speak as if the study of the classics would at length make way for more modern and practical studies." He rebuttal in <em>Walden, and On The Duty of Civil Disobedience</em>:</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">For what are the classics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man? They are the only oracles which are not decayed, and there are such answers to the most modern inquiry in them as Delphi and Dodona never gave. <span class='highlight'>We might as well omit to study Nature because she is old.</span> To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>He's saying that the cure for our precipitancy in seeking out the latest, fleeting knowledge online is to look back at timeless works of art.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something at once more intimate with us and more universal than any other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to life itself. It may be translated into every language, and not only be read but actually breathed from all human lips;—not be represented on canvas or in marble only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself. The symbol of an ancient man’s thought becomes a modern man’s speech. Two thousand summers have imparted to the monuments of Grecian literature, as to her marbles, only a maturer golden and autumnal tint, for they have carried their own serene and celestial atmosphere into all lands to protect them against the corrosion of time. Books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations. Books, the oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every society, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind.</div>
</div>
</p>
      <p>He touches on the idea of universality and the idea that many of our modern troubles are enduring problems that have been faced by people for millennia but in a new context.</p>
      <p><div class="attributed-quote">
  <div class="single-blockquote">The book exists for us perchance which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unutterable things we may find somewhere uttered. These same questions that disturb and puzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise men; not one has been omitted; and each has answered them, according to his ability, by his words and his life. Moreover, with wisdom we shall learn liberality. The solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts of Concord, who has had his second birth and peculiar religious experience, and is driven as he believes into the silent gravity and exclusiveness by his faith, may think it is not true; but Zoroaster, thousands of years ago, travelled the same road and had the same experience; but he, being wise, knew it to be universal, and treated his neighbors accordingly, and is even said to have invented and established worship among men. Let him humbly commune with Zoroaster then, and through the liberalizing influence of all the worthies, with Jesus Christ himself, and let “our church” go by the board</div>
