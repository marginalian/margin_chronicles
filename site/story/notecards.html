    Mittens and money were alike far off from my fingers, and friends were as scarce as money.

    Having joined the blockading fleet again, we led the same sort of life as before: now at anchor, then giving chase; now standing in shore, and anon standing out to sea; firing, and being fired at, without once coming into action.

    BL: brilliantly quarrelsome
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>The Mayor of Casterbridge - Thomas Hardy</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    But there was more in that tent than met the cursory glance; and the man, with the instinct of a perverse character, scented it quickly. After a mincing attack on his bowl, he watched the hag's proceedings from the corner of his eye, and saw the game she played. He winked to her, and passed up his basin in reply to her nod; when she took a bottle from under the table, slily measured out a quantity of its contents, and tipped the same into the man's furmity. The liquor poured in was rum. The man as slily sent back money in payment.

He found the concoction, thus strongly laced, much more to his satisfaction than it had been in its natural state. His wife had observed the proceeding with much uneasiness; but he persuaded her to have hers laced also, and she agreed to a milder allowance after some misgiving.

The man finished his basin, and called for another, the rum being signalled for in yet stronger proportion. The effect of it was soon apparent in his manner, and his wife but too sadly perceived that in strenuously steering off the rocks of the licensed liquor-tent she had only got into maelstrom depths here amongst the smugglers.

The child began to prattle impatiently, and the wife more than once said to her husband, "Michael, how about our lodging? You know we may have trouble in getting it if we don't go soon."

But he turned a deaf ear to those bird-like chirpings. He talked loud to the company. The child's black eyes, after slow, round, ruminating gazes at the candles when they were lighted, fell together; then they opened, then shut again, and she slept.

At the end of the first basin the man had risen to serenity; at the second he was jovial; at the third, argumentative, at the fourth, the qualities signified by the shape of his face, the occasional clench of his mouth, and the fiery spark of his dark eye, began to tell in his conduct; he was overbearing—even brilliantly quarrelsome.

  <div class='quote'>
    The auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be heard saying, "Now this is the last lot—now who'll take the last lot for a song? Shall I say forty shillings? 'Tis a very promising broodmare, a trifle over five years old, and nothing the matter with the hoss at all, except that she's a little holler in the back and had her left eye knocked out by the kick of another, her own sister, coming along the road."

"For my part I don't see why men who have got wives and don't want 'em, shouldn't get rid of 'em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses," said the man in the tent. "Why shouldn't they put 'em up and sell 'em by auction to men who are in need of such articles? Hey? Why, begad, I'd sell mine this minute if anybody would buy her!"

    Scream never leaves the body
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>The Elephant Vanishes - Haruki Murakami</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    I closed my eyes and let out a scream so loud it took every ounce of strength I had. But it never left my body. It reverberated soundlessly inside, tearing through me, shutting down my heart. Everything inside my head turned white for a moment as the scream penetrated my every cell. Something inside me died. Something melted away, leaving only a shuddering vacuum. An explosive flash incinerated everything my existence depended on.

    Misunderstanding of Modern Life by the Poor
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Black Orpheus - Jacques Viot</em>

  <div class='quote'>
    [Orpheu arrives at the 13th floor: department of missing persons]

ORPHEU: Anybody there?

JANITOR: What are you looking for, brother?

ORPHEU: The missing person's department.

JANITOR: There is such a department, but I never saw any missing persons there. Just mountains of paper. Missing persons is right there. See? There's no one there. Just piles of paper. The whole place is full of it. 15 floors of paper. All for nothing... Can you read?

ORPHEU: Yes.

JANITOR: I can't. Look around if you like. But you won't find any missing persons among those papers. On the contrary. That's where they go missing.
  </div>

  
    <div class='note'>
      Incongruity. A man who works in the missing person's department, which is filled with paper, cannot read. His perception is different from the norm. He interprets what he sees without understanding the system.

    The Zodiac Scarf: Symbol as Characterization
  </div>

  <div class='source'>
    <em>Black Orpheus - Jacques Viot</em>
  </div>

  <div class='quote'>
    [Orpheu holds up a scarf with an animal design]

ORPHEU: The dog tore up one of the little animals.

EURYDICE: (Laughing) They're not animals. They're the signs of the zodiac.

ORPHEU: It's beautiful.

EURYDICE: (Pointing) This is where I was born. My house in the heavens.

ORPHEU: (Laughing) A baby sheep? I'll take the one next door, so I'll always be near you. Would you like that? (Kisses her hand) Good night.

EURYDICE: Good night.

[The next morning]

MIRA: (Notices Orpheu wearing the scarf) Is this new? Looks cheap. What are these little animals?

ORPHEU: They're not animals. They're the signs of the zodiac.

MIRA: (Sarcasticly) Signs of the zodiac&mdash;you don't say. And the girl next door took you to heaven last night, right? Answer me! Here's what I think of that bitch's dirty rag! I'll show you! (Rips the scarf)
  </div>

  
    <div class='note'>
      Lots to like here. A sweet moment centers around Erydice correcting her new lover's misunderstanding. He uses the newfound knowledge to craft a metaphor and profess his love. Later on, a character we are meant to hate rips the scarf, convincing the audience to dislike her.
