      <h1 id='samuel&#95;r.&#95;delany' >Samuel R. Delany</h1><br />
      <p id='' >If you choose to read Delany's critical work alongside his fiction, his command of form becomes obvious. His writing about writing is literate and exemplary of acadmic writing. He obviously delights in using the most precise word he can find for what he's trying to communicate, even if that word is archaic, which enriches the critical form. But, oftentimes, this is a red flag that a writer's fiction will be dry, overwritten and dull. Not the case with Delany.</p>
      <h1 id='set&#95;one&#95;of&#95;his&#95;essays&#95;side&#95;by&#95;side&#95;with&#95;a&#95;short&#95;story,&#95;and&#95;it'd&#95;be&#95;easy&#95;to&#95;believe&#95;two&#95;different&#95;writers&#95;were&#95;responsible&#95;for&#95;them.&#95;his&#95;fiction&#95;is&#95;readable,&#95;crisp&#95;and&#95;experimental.' >Set one of his essays side by side with a short story, and it'd be easy to believe two different writers were responsible for them. His fiction is readable, crisp and experimental.</h1>    </article>
