This is the repository behind [The Margin Chronicles](https://marginchronicles.com) website. At it's core, this project is a plaintext wiki for reading notes: a kind of digital commonplace book. The [MMX](https://github.com/marginalian/mmx) static site generator transforms the plaintext files in the `wiki` directory into the HTML files found in the `site` directory.
