-  Little languages are everywhere
"  For every successful general-purpose language out there, there are a
   thousand successful niche ones. We used to call them “little languages”, but
   inflation in the jargon economy led today to the name “domain-specific
   languages”. These are pidgins tailor-built to a specific task. Things like
   application scripting languages, template engines, markup formats, and
   configuration files.
