"  Oren showed me bootleg holo-clips of earth, where the superbeings of the Patronage elite watched games in which bewildered colonists from the outlier worlds fought each other to the death. Holo-clips depicting thousands slaughtered in metal factories, their meat served at the finest underwater restaurants where the Patronage elites sipped wine and lazily watched fish swim by. Others showed endless rows of brains in briny liquid and connected to machinery, human slaves whose bodies had been ripped away to create factory automation with human judgement.

-  Immortality as torture
"  At that time, and likely still, the task of seeding the galaxy fell to the lowest of the low, the worst criminals of our age. Unfortunate souls whose bodies were discarded, their brains broken apart and re-formed around quantum computer elements. What was left of the neural tissue was tied to vast arrays of qubits using chemical bonds that fuse living cells with germanium. All this while cold machines inserted their unfeeling directives directly into that violated gray matter, stealing away most volition. For all of the 27th century’s scientific triumphs, no one had ever designed machinery that could emulate human judgement—meaning that an Oelinium had to retain at its center the vestiges of a human being. To the extent that any humanity remained, it was a broken shell devoid of eyes, ears, and any other human sense, stripped away of all will by a robot overlord. A fate worse than any torture, for the inquisitions of human history had always at least allowed the final respite of death

"  To say that I ‘awoke’ sometime later cannot truly convey my first moments as a machine. My initial recollection is one of utter senselessness. I have no sight, no hearing, no taste, no feeling. I float disembodied, with only disconnected thoughts to let me know I live. It is like dreaming, for random images and stories parade through my spinning semi-consciousness. But unlike a dream, a tiny piece of myself surveys everything.
"  Then, the cold steel of the Monitor intrudes on my mind. It bends my drifting thoughts towards solid purpose, fills me with an iron-willed determination to perform my function. I ache to return to my dream-like state, but the Monitor forces me to concentrate on cold, meaningless things. I feel sudden hatred, and begin fighting this with every ounce of strength I have.
"  I believe I ‘awoke’ sooner than was planned. The Monitor’s integration was supposed to complete before I was allowed to retrieve any part of myself. Why this mistake occurred I don’t know, but it allowed me to fight my jailer for every neuron, every cortical column.
"  And fight I did. I fought the Monitor in the shattered remnants of my limbic system, I fought it in my emotional centers, I fought it through every neural pathway until I thought I’d die. To this day, I believe the gains established in this early battle gave me the freedom to do what I eventually did.

They write science fiction, I imagine, because what they have to say is best said using the tools of science fiction, and the craftsman knows his tools. And still, they are novelists, because while using the great rande of imagery available to science fiction, they say what it is they have to say through a character--not a mouthpiece, but a full realized creation. The character is primary. And what used to be the entire object of science fiction--the invention of miraculous gadgets, the relations of alternate histories, and so on--is now used subjectively, as a metaphor, as a means for exploring and explaining what goes on inside [the character].

"  I limit my answers to their questions to technology. I let them assume, as most people naturally assume, particularly people from a monoculture, that our society is pretty much like theirs. When they find how it differs, the effect will be revolutionary, and I have no mandate, reason, or wish to cause such a revolution on Seggri. Their gender imbalance has produced a society in which, as far as I can tell, the men have all the privilege and the women have all the power. It’s obviously a stable arrangement. According to their histories, it’s lasted at least two millennia, and probably in some form or another much longer than that. But it could be quickly and disastrously destabilised by contact with us, by their experiencing the human norm. I don’t know if the men would cling to their privileged status or demand freedom, but surely the women would resist giving up their power, and their sexual system and affectional relationships would break down. Even if they learned to undo the genetic program that was inflicted on them, it would take several generations to restore normal gender distribution.

They’d take it as a claim of superiority, which he’d have to defend in trials of strength and skill. I gather that the hierarchies within the castles are a rigid framework, within which a man moves up or down issuing challenges and winning or losing obligatory and optional trials. The sports and games the women watch are only the showpieces of an endless series of competitions going on inside the castles. As an untrained, grown man Kaza would be at a total disadvantage in such trials. The only way he might get out of them, she said, would be by feigning illness or idiocy. She thinks he must have done so, since he is at least alive; but that’s all she could find out

To see life as a battle is a narrow, social-Darwinist view, and a very masculine one. Conflict, of course, is part of life, I’m not saying you should try to keep it out of your stories, just that it’s not their only lifeblood. Stories are about a lot of different things.

-  Mainstream authors reinvent scifi tropes often
"  [Many literary writers] haven’t read any science fiction. They have no idea really what it can do or what it’s about. What tends to happen is that they laboriously reinvent the wheel. They get an idea, which is a commonplace idea in science fiction, one that has been worked over a thousand times, worked over with all kinds of literary variations, but because science fiction was not taught as literature they don’t know that. They take this old well-worn idea and bring it forth, declaring, “Look! Look at this wonderful idea I had!”

-  A novel is large enough to slow down and enjoy the details
"  Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else in this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story. In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool's joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn't over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.

"  That's why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them. So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great, heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse's skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don't understand.

-  There is more to fiction than heroes and conflict
"  The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting here and going straight there and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn't any good if he isn't in it.
"  I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural,  proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.

If so, if they had regained territory, why had the government pulled out of the city and dug in down at Bellen?

Not now. Never again. Since the Uprising, the Liberation is an army, a political body, a great number of people and leaders and would-be leaders, ambitions and greed clogging hopes and strength, a clumsy amateur semi-government lurching from violence to compromise, ever more complicated, never again to know the beautiful simplicity of the ideal, the pure idea of liberty. And that’s what I wanted, what I worked for, all these years. To muddle the nobly simple structure of the hierarchy of caste by infecting it with the idea of justice. And then to confuse the nobly simple structure of the ideal of human equality by trying to make it real. The monolithic lie frays out into a thousand incompatible truths, and that’s what I wanted.

-  Strengths and weaknesses of present tense
"  I see the big difference between the past and present tenses not as immediacy but as complexity and size of field. A story told in the present tense is necessarily focused on action in a single time and therefore a single place. Use of the past tense(s) allows continual referring back and forth in time and space. That’s how our minds normally work, moving around easily. Only in emergency situations do they focus very tightly on what’s going on. And so narration in the present tense sets up a kind of permanent artificial emergency, which can be exactly the right tone for fast-paced action. The past tense can also focus tightly, but it always gives access to time before and after the moment of the narrative. The moment it describes is a moment continuous with its past and its future. The difference is like the difference between a narrow-beam flashlight and sunlight. One shows a small, intense, brightly lit field with nothing around it; the other shows the world.

Just make it clear that this bit is going on inside somebody’s head. Ways of doing so are various:   As soon as she heard Jim shout, Aunt Jane knew Fred had swallowed the grommet after all.   I just know he’s going to swallow that grommet again, Jane said to herself as she sorted buttons.   Oh, Jane thought, I do wish the old fool would hurry up and swallow that grommet!

-  Story vs plot
"  I define story as a narrative of events (external or psychological) that moves through time or implies the passage of time and that involves change. I define plot as a form of story that uses action as its mode, usually in the form of conflict, and that closely and intricately connects one act to another, usually through a causal chain, ending in a climax. Climax is one kind of pleasure; plot is one kind of story. A strong, shapely plot is a pleasure in itself. It can be reused generation after generation. It provides an armature for narrative that beginning writers may find invaluable. But most serious modern fictions can’t be reduced to a plot or retold without fatal loss except in their own words. The story is not in the plot but in the telling. It is the telling that moves.

-  Story is not only conflict
"  Modernist manuals of writing often conflate story with conflict. This reductionism reflects a culture that inflates aggression and competition while cultivating ignorance of other behavioral options. No narrative of any complexity can be built on or reduced to a single element. Conflict is one kind of behavior. There are others, equally important in any human life, such as relating, finding, losing, bearing, discovering, parting, changing.

-  Stories need coherence
"  And a story equally needs what Jill Paton Walsh calls a trajectory—not necessarily an outline or synopsis to follow, but a movement to follow: the shape of a movement, whether it be straight ahead or roundabout or recurrent or eccentric, a movement that never ceases, from which no passage departs entirely or for long and to which all passages contribute in some way. This trajectory is the shape of the story as a whole. It moves always to its end, and its end is implied in its beginning.

And finally the shock waves: the walls sang! Magnetic inductance oscillated over our ship, nearly rattled us apart. But then it was too late. I was blind.” He sat back in his chair. “I’m blind, boy.

Whoever owned the ship wanted to allow for proprietary research; the only security cameras were on the hatches, nothing in the crew areas. Or nothing I could access. But the presence in the feed was too big and diffuse for a human or augmented human, I could tell that much even through the feed walls protecting it. And it sounded like a bot.

A SecUnit could cause it a lot of internal damage if it wasn’t careful, and rogue SecUnits were not exactly known for lying low and avoiding trouble. I hadn’t hurt the last transport I had taken a ride on, but it didn’t know that. I didn’t understand why it had let me aboard, if it really didn’t want to hurt me. I wouldn’t have trusted me, if I was a transport. Maybe it was like me, and it had taken an opportunity because it was there, not because it knew what it wanted. It was still an asshole, though. Six episodes later I felt the transport in the feed again, lurking. I ignored it, though it had to know I knew it was there.

It went down on one knee, swinging its projectile weapon toward me, energy weapons unfolding out of its armor. With the combat override module in place, its feed was cut off, and with its comm down it couldn’t yell for help. Also, depending on how strictly they had limited its voluntary actions, it might not be able to call for help unless the GrayCris humans told it to.

This theory says that structuring fiction is like kicking off from the side of a swimming pool. The stronger and more forceful your initial kick, the longer you can glide through the water.

"  A writer always pays a price for flashbacks. Any flashback, no matter how well written or interesting, will distance your reader from the action. This is because flashbacks shatter the illusion that the reader is a fly on the wall, witnessing events as they happen, right now. The flashback is not happening right now—it is, by definition, already over. Are you more thrilled by a kiss you experience today or one you remember from a year ago? Flashbacks are not as immediate as story time. Even so, the flashback can be a good choice for a second scene if you gain more in depth and clarity than you lose in immediacy.

You can, of course, just have your characters stand around discussing a situation they're all already familiar with but we're not.

This is because you now have a firmer idea of who your character is, what the conflict will be, and what the tone of the story will be. You have, by your first scene, committed to certain directions for each of these. Knowing that can keep you from wandering into different directions.

-  Characterization: dramatic vs explicit
"  The writer characterizes thorugh two basic methods, the _explicit_ and the _dramatic_. The choice between the two seems to follow a kind of faddish cycle, with James' reaction to the explicit techniques of the nineteenth century novel expressed in his exhortation to "Dramatize! Dramatize!" now appearing in writers workshops as "Show, don't tell!" But the pendulum swings, and if the explicit method is not yet in vogue, it is holding its own. The writer who chooses the explicit method of characterization has limited her choice of point of view (she requires omniscience or a third-person narrator), but she has two powerful tools: the _essay method_, concentrated expository character portraits, and the _method of progressive analysis_, a running commentary on the actions and motivations of the character.
"  The dramatic (or implicit) method of characterizationrequires that the character be revealed through the opinions of other characters, through his interactions with his environment, and through his acted-out attitudes toward others.

-  Characters are bound in a story by _quantity_ and _function_
"  Characters are presented in accord with two judgments the writer must make: the _quantity_ of information about the character the reader must have and the _function_ of the charater in the story. The quantitative decision is particularly important in short fiction, where every word must count, and the writer--who is as interested in her creations as any fond parent--must struggle against prolixity. The functional decision helps to determine the quantitative one by distinguishing between central and marginal characters. But even here, the writer who plots by the "plant some characters in a situation and see what grows" method is likely to see some unimportant little sprout suddenly develop great leaves and strong tentacles threatening to strangle the rest of the tale.

"  Moving almost like a Drive-ship, Bux seemed to cease to exist on the visitor's chair and reappeared instantaneously at the side of the desk, a long thick arm extended and a meaty hand blocking the way to the stud. "Hear me out first," he said, softly. Really softly. It was a much more astonishing thing than if the Archive Master had trumpeted like an elephant. "Hear me out. Please."

-  Questions to help get to an ending
"  There are questions I use to [reason out the ending].
"  One such question is: How do I want the protagonist to end up changed by the events of the story? Knowing that can sometimes help the writerwork backward. This is the way events changed him--what events do I need to bring about such a change? That's the climax.
"  [...]
"  A second question to help figure out endings is: Who won and who lost? This derives from a useful metaphor about fiction, which is that every story--every single one, from _Hamlet_, to _The Meatloaf that Ate Toledo_-- is a war.

-  The Kress Swimming Pool Theory of Fiction
"  Aren't __all__ scenes supposed to advance plot?
"  Not necessarily. The Kress Swimming Pool Theory of Fiction comes into play here. This theory says that scene order is like kicking off from the side of a swimming pool. The harder the initial kick, the longer and further you can glide. A first scene with conflict and action and rapid introduction of new information earns you the right to a slower following scene that adds backfill and focuses on comparative subtleties of tone, character, setting, or motif. Scene two of "Oranges" is all exposition."

-  "Or the story would be over"
"  "Character is plot," said Henry James, who did pretty well with both. My translation of this is "Why are these people doing what they're doing?" Understanding the motivations of all your major characters, not just the protagonist, can suggest plot developments. Plot and character--the double helix of fiction. So, I asked myself, the man that Harry snares and forcibly brings back to 1989--what does __that__ character want?
"  Not Jackie. Or the story would be over.
"  Okay, start here. He doesn't want Jackie. Why not? Because their personalities clash. Because the man has a life in his own time. Because he's married. Yes--that would fit with poor Harry's attempts: well-meaning but inept. After all, if Harry were good at time travel, he'd bring back not oranges but stock certificates, and end up rich. Harry, however, is not that sort of man ("Plot is character"). Harry, even when ating out of love, screws up ("Plot is one damned thing after another").

-  Types of tempo
"  _Normal tempo_ is the conventional balance between the realistic slowness of most human happenings and the need to compress these happenings to fit the limitations of the reader's patience. _Retarded tempo_ expands time, often to a pace far slower than real time, to allow the writer to examine events in great details.
"  [...]
"  _Accelerated tempo_ is the pace of the action-adventure tale or the documentary history, the furious rush of events the leaves the hero (and the reader) breathless. Tempo is not necessarily uniform throughout the story; its variation in conformity with the author's intentions is part of his craft, something he achieves as much through stylistics devices as through his selection and arrangement of events in the plot.

-  Art + Science = Science Fiction
"  Perhaps this interesting tradition of communal artistic enterprise results from the very nature of science, the essenece of art, and their curious union in science fiction. French scientist Claude Bernard, who was a so-so playwrite but a world-renowned Third Republic physiologist, put it this way:
"  "Art," he wrote, "is I; science is we."
"  Perhaps the melding of these two in our genre has hatched the idea of the (perforce) lone artist working within a network of supportive colleagues and mentors which seems to be such an integral part of the American science fiction scene.

"  She watched him through half-closed eyes. She was sleek and poised in french jeans and a golden leotard, her hair tied up in a scarf with just a few strands floating free around her face.
"  She had not always been so confident. Tony had met Diane three years before, when she was a drama student, working part-time at the steakhouse that he managed. One afternoon, her car had refused to start and she was late for an audition. Tony had driven her to the audition and she had cried on his shoulder when the director gave the part to another girl. A week later, he celebrated with her when she got a part in another play. Eventually she moved into the house in the Berkeley hills. For two years, they had lived together happily. She had needed him then: for reassurance, for comfort.
"  He claimed that she had stopped loving him the day she was mentioned favorably in a review. She had changed: lost weight, learned to use makeup. She had turned into a slim-hipped, honey-tanned California girl with a laugh like the sound of Almaden Mountain Rhine wine pouring into a tumbler--sweet but a little vulgar. A lady with a mind like a racing car engine. Not a Swiss watch--this lady was built for power.
"  She had started bringing her actor friends home: people with names like Vancouver John and the Lizard King. That's when the fights started.
"  "You don't spend time with me anymore," he had complained. "You're too busy with your friends."
"  "That's not true and you know it. You're just feeling sorry for yourself. I'm doing things I want to do and you resent that. You wanted me to stay the way I was--a shy, weak, little girl. You wanted me to..."
"  "I wanted a woman I could love."
"  "You wanted a woman who wouldn't change."
"  When Diane got a chance to tour with a traveling company she and Tony agreed--in a reasonable, calm fashion--that their life together had come to an end.

"  He would tell her how the little wasps dissolved his clothes and his pack and the water he had brought with him spilled on the barren ground, but still he walked towards her. Then the medium-sized wasps began to land on him, and they didn't quite sting, it was more like an embrace that covered him. The wasps began to spread out their mechanical bodies until they covered every inch of him, even his eyes and his mouth, and he could not breathe and they tightened their embrace. It did not hurt and he felt like he was flying and that it might have been a good way to die if not for all the fear.

"  He rode to the suburb from the north. To his left, dawn was breaking, sending the first pearl-coloured streaks into the sky. He had been travelling through the night, following the freeway, but it had ended abruptly, buried under an old landslide. He had turned aside to pick his way through the thin patch of scrubby bush.
"    He knew he had reached the suburb when the vegetation gave way suddenly to the stubborn concrete of a shopping center's parking lot. It stretched agead of him, an immense open space. Nothing moved. He turned his attention to the remaining giant letters above him. Once they had made up part of the center's name. Now they hung askew, their bolts corroded through.
"    He pulled out one of his street maps, and opened it. The position was marked. He checked the nearby street names, then carefully folded the tattered paper and replaced it in his pack. With a low clicking of his tongue he urged the tired horse on, toward the center of the suburb.
"    His mount picked its way carefully over the cracked concrete while he studied his surroundings.
"    A rusted shopping cart lay to one side, stripped of its wheels. Small arcades branched off from the main building. Most windows were broken, the shelves emptied of useful items. A china shop stood undamaged; its painted plates and figurines glittering richly in the rays of the rising sun, while next door a furniture shop still boasted a disount on the deflated water bed in the window.
"    Silence hung over the morning. The birds were learning not to sing.
"    The bounty hunter turned his gaze toward the approaching streets and houses. Grass and weed clogged the gutters, and broke up the bitumen. Where street signs remained, they were barely legible; in some places, they were missing completely. The houses were unoccupied; engulfed in flowering bushes, roofs sagging. He expected that. They mostly clustered in the centers of the suburbs now, close to the government supplies.
"    A sudden movement sent his hand darting for the rifle slung over his shoulder. In a flurry of ruffled feathers and frightened peeping, a wild duck and two ducklings burst from the grass onto the open road.

His arm went around her, and she felt the bar slam into her shoulder blade, which made her right arm go pins-and-needles numb. She threw a throat punch at him with it, and even though she couldn't feel it, her arm did what she told it to. Crowbar dropped his weapon and clutched his throat with both hands, gagging.
